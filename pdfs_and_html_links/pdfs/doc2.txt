This acknowledges that we are collecting the City of Pittsburgh Amusement tax as agents for the City of Pittsburgh and that all Amusement tax revenues 
collected are the property of t
he City of Pittsburgh from the time that they are collected from patrons.  It is understood that the collected tax revenue shall 
remain in a segregated account held in trust
 for the City of Pittsburgh, until such time as the funds are properly delivered to the City Treasurer.  In the event of 
bankruptcy by the producer,
 whether voluntary or involuntary, such funds will not become part of the bankruptcy estate; rather they will be turned over to their 
rightful owner, the City
 of Pittsburgh.

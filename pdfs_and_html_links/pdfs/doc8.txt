This acknowledges that we are collecting the City of Pittsburgh Amusement tax as agents for the City of Pittsburgh and that all Amusement tax revenues collected are the property of the 
City of Pittsburgh from the time that they are collected from patrons.  It is understood that the collected tax revenue shall remain in a segregated account held in trust for the City of 
Pittsburgh, until such time as the funds are properly delivered to the City Treasurer.  In the event of bankruptcy by the producer, whether voluntary or involuntary, such funds will not 
become part of the bankruptcy estate; rather they will be turned over to their rightful owner, the City of Pittsburgh.

 Pennsylvania Act 7 of 2007 requires that the $52 be deducted evenly from paychecks throughout the year .  A worker who is
paid weekly would see the tax deducted at the rate of $1 a week; while someone who is paid bi-weekly would pay $2 every pay.
Act 7 also provides for an upfront exemption when:
 Total earned income from all sources within Pittsburgh is less than $12,000.
 On active duty.
 Employee is an honorably discharged veteran with 100% service-connected disability.
An annual upfront exemption certificate must be completed by the employee and submitted to their employer to qualify  for the

The original Penguins Hall of Fame ran intermittently between the inaugural 1992 class and the most-recent induction in 2013. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced the first 10 players and builders that have been elected into their relaunched Hall of Fame. These 10 individuals will have their induction ceremonies spread throughout the next three seasons.

Caggiano Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. Elaine Heufelder Mike Lange Vince Lascheid Frank Scuilli Previous Previous / fullscreen The Pittsburgh Penguins Hall of Fame is selected by a voting committee that currently includes 21 members. This group is comprised of former players, coaches, general managers, broadcasters and club employees, who are joined by members of the local television, radio and print media, all of whom cover the team on a regular basis. Among the criteria that voters must weigh for Penguins Hall of Fame player candidates are career statistics, playoff performance, longevity and consistency, legacy and off-ice impact, team contributions and league/team awards and recognition. The lone eligibility requirement is that players must be retired for one season before they become eligible for election. For builders, the criteria for consideration are longevity, regular-season success relative to their peers, playoff success, legacy and off-ice impact, and whether the builder helped the team win the Stanley Cup during their tenure.

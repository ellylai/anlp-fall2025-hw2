"Celebrating the game of football - at all levels - is something that is important to us and creating a new platform for one of our flagship youth football programs is another step towards that." In addition to the broadcast, the Steelers will continue to bring plenty of energy to the game with appearances by a current or former player who will serve as an honorary co-captain each week, along with appearances by Steely McBeam. The team will also continue to provide live social coverage of the games on its official Youth Football platforms, as well as share a highlights package of each game on those social platforms and on Steelers.com . The games will be further highlighted as part of game entertainment during Steelers home games at Acrisure Stadium. The Steelers High School Showcase Game of the Week first launched in 2018. The program is one on a list of endeavors the Steelers have undertaken to help in the education and growth of youth football.

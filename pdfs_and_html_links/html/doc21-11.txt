In partnership with PNC, the Women of Steel Small Business Spotlight program will receive support from executives at PNC and the Pittsburgh Steelers, providing mentorship to women-owned small businesses while utilizing the Steelers platform to bring awareness to them.â Both organizations believe in a world where women transform companies and push society forward. This program is finding ways to support females, drive them to the top, and keep them climbing.â 2024 Honorees Stories Like Me Helen Campbell / Co-Owner and CEO Helen Campbell (she/her) and Imogen Campbell Hendricks (she/her) - co-owners, business partners, and mom and daughter team - are thrilled to be selected as Women of Steel. Stories Like Me is an indie bookstore for children through young adults, a community hub, and a safe space where all people can find themselves represented in books. To build their business, Helen and Imogen drew on their love of stories, along with their skills as project management professionals and musicians (musicians are very detail-oriented!). Before opening their brick-and-mortar store in Greenfield in November 2022, they did small pop-ups all throughout Pittsburgh to bring diverse stories into the community. Helen, a native of England began her career in film and TV, after which she worked as a project manager, brings all her Jedi/Mary Poppins-type super powers to making sure all kids and families can see themselves in stories. Imogen, named after a character from Shakespeare, reads everything voraciously, writes, organizes, and loves trying out boutique gins! They find their joy and passion through finding stories for all of our kids and families. Fierce Knockouts Karin Christoff / Owner Karin, a proud mother of two teenage boys and married to a fellow veteran, brings a unique journey to her business. Originally from Peru, she arrived in the U.S. with no English skills but, through much sacrifice, learned by attending night school. She served as a U.S. Army soldier and was deployed to Afghanistan. She earned her bachelor's in information technology and MBA after she was honorably discharged from active duty. Inspired by her personal experiences during the pandemic, Karin founded Fierce Knockouts to address a gap in workout apparel for women. She recognized that many women gain weight around their midsection, yet most clothes are designed for an ideal body shape. By creating beautiful, confidence-boosting workout clothes, Karin aims to make busy women feel amazing whether they're working out, running errands, or doing chores at home. Her mission is to empower and uplift women, one outfit at a time. Mele's Gifts & Party Planning Jarmele E. Fairclaugh / Gift Creator & Owner Founded in 2019 by Gift Creator and Owner Jarmele E. Fairclaugh, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning emerged from a deeply personal journey. What began as a heartfelt tradition of creating custom gifts for Jarmele's beloved grandmother, who resided in a nursing facility, has grown into a thriving business dedicated to celebrating life's special moments. Jarmele's mission started with simple acts of loveâgift-wrapping chocolates, clothing, and shoes to bring a smile to her grandmother's face. Her grandmother, a cherished beacon of joy and strength in the family following the passing of Jarmele's mother, inspired the creation of Mele's Gifts & Party Planning. Following her grandmother's passing, Jarmele's familyâher son Michael and husband Markâencouraged her to turn her passion into a business. They established a website and business cards, and with their support, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning was born. Today, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning is proud to be part of a vibrant community of woman-owned businesses and is honored to be recognized as a Woman of Steel by the Pittsburgh Steelers and PNC Bank. We specialize in custom-created gifts and exceptional event planning, dedicated to turning your ideas into reality and making every occasion memorable. Celebrate with us, and let's bring your vision to life! The Colombian Spot Karen Perdomo / Owner Karen Perdomo, a Colombian and New Jersey native, with a background in school business administration, opened The Colombian Spot, a family business, in the former Pittsburgh Public Market in October of 2015 introducing Arepas in the city of Pittsburgh for the first time. Starting as a small business with a limited space and a limited menu, it grew into a full service restaurant in the South Side neighborhood and ever since, this has been the Latin spot for many families in a time where Latin American restaurants were non-existent in the city . Later in 2022, a second location opened in the Oakland area near Pitt campus offering take out options for students and professionals. While Empanadas and Arepas are the signature items on the menu, The Colombian Spot offers a diverse Latin American fusion menu, and catering services. Karen's leadership, strategy, organization, discipline, and vision for the business, has developed many growing opportunities, including catering services for corporate and professional baseball teams, as well as community affiliations with Latin organizations and other local neighborhood organizations.

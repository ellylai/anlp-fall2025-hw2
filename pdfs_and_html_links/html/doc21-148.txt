Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr. never kept it a secret what mattered to him. There were three things that were the foundation of what he believed in. Family, faith and football. His passion was his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers. He built a football legacy that continued with his family, his son, Dan Rooney Sr., his grandson, Steelers President Art Rooney II, and now his great-grandson, Dan Rooney, the Steelers Vice President of Business Development and Strategy. He always held his faith close, which inspired him to give back to others in need, those who were suffering the most. That desire to give back is felt to this day by those at the Catholic Youth Association (CYA), a local organization that Art Rooney Sr., known as 'The Chief,' stepped in to help when he saw they were struggling financially back in the 1970s. He wanted to help one of his favorite charities, one that embodied the Catholic faith that was a major part of his life, ensuring that they would be able to continue with their mission. It was from that passion that the Art Rooney Award Dinner was born, an annual event that benefits the CYA. It's an event that has embodied what he believed in, and one Art Rooney II and Dan Rooney are also an integral part of. The annual dinner was held on Tuesday night at Acrisure Stadium, bringing together Pittsburgh's leaders in business, education and sports to combine efforts to help the CYA serve the most vulnerable in the communityâ¦children and the elderly. The dinner honors those that have made a difference in the community and have a passion for Pittsburgh. "It's great to carry on the legacy that my great grandfather started 50 plus years ago, one that is deeply attached to the Pittsburgh community and caring about those that live here, work here and just giving back to Pittsburgh," said Dan Rooney. "I know that's something my great grandfather cared deeply about, and it's something he was able to pass on to my grandfather and father. "You have to be able to show up ready to help those around you. This event is about helping those that are in need, whether you are on the younger side or the older side. Pittsburghers help each other out. "I know my great grandfather stood for that and we are celebrating that here tonight. The fact that we can continue to have this dinner at our stadium and celebrate the champions of our community, while helping others, is very special." Among the honorees this year is Louis Cestello, who received the Art Rooney Award, presented to an individual for their service to the region and caring for the community the way Art Rooney Sr. did. Cestello is the executive vice president, head of Regional Presidents and regional president of Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania for PNC Bank. He also oversees PNC's corporate sponsorships and the Women's Business Development group. "I'm humbled to accept an award named after 'The Chief,' said Cestello. "Art Rooney Sr. built more than a legendary football franchise; he built a culture of integrity, teamwork, and giving back to the community. PNC, the Rooney family and the Steelers organization share a long and proud history rooted in those same values. To be recognized as part of that legacy is an incredible honor." Cestello has a strong involvement with the Pittsburgh community, where he is a member of the board of directors for the PNC Foundation, The Dietrich Foundation, Caves Valley Golf Club and Laurel Valley Golf Club. He is a also a member of the board of trustees for the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and an emeritus member of the board of trustees for The University of Pittsburgh. Cestello holds a bachelor's degree from Washington & Jefferson College and a master's degree in business administration from Duquesne University. "Art Rooney Sr. understood that you don't win alone. Whether on the field or in the community, real impact happens when people come together to meet a common goal," said Cestello. "That's how I view my role at PNC. I'm just one player on a much larger team committed to making a difference. While I'm honored to accept this award, it's not about me, it's about PNC as an organization and the collective good we're able to accomplish when Pittsburgh rallies together. "Like the Steelers on game day, every person has a role to play. When we each do our part, we lift each other up, strengthen our neighborhoods, and build a community where everyone can thrive." Dr. Kathy Wilson Humphrey, the President of Carlow University, was presented with the Patricia R. Rooney Award, named after the late wife of Dan Rooney Sr. and presented annually to a woman who has provided exceptional service to the Pittsburgh community. "I am immeasurably honored for the award to be named after a committed, compassionate leader dedicated to education, impacting generations and changing people's lives by her work," said Dr. Humphrey. "It is not only a sense of accomplishment, but inspiration." Dr. Humphrey has more than 40 years of experience in higher education, focused on helping students build a strong academic foundation while developing into solid citizens and contributors to society. She continues Carlow's Mercy heritage and commitment to social justice as the key to positively impact and transforming lives. "First and foremost, Pittsburgh is my home. I have a firm belief, 'To much is given, much is required," said Dr. Humphrey. "Throughout my life, even at an early age, much has been given to me. Every day I feel obligated to give back and make a difference. It is not only an expectation of myself, but for those who work with me. Our collective efforts are creating ethical leaders, to create a more just and merciful world throughout the Pittsburgh community. " In addition to her commitment to helping students and Carlow grow as a whole, she also serves on the boards of directors for UPMC, Gwen's Girls, The Forbes Funds, and the Federal Reserve Board of Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Dr. Humphrey also serves on the Executive Committee of the International Women's Forum of Pittsburgh and is an active member of Macedonia Church on the Hill and Delta Sigma Theta. "The work I do is a calling," said Dr. Humphrey. "Helping young people achieve their educational goals or aspirations, even as a professor, provides me so much joy. It gives me incredible joy, incredible satisfaction, and every time I participate in a commencement ceremony, and I see a student move from a space of desire to a space of completion, the sense of accomplishment in their eyes warms my heart. Their goals are my goals. Their accomplishments have become my accomplishments. "At Carlow University, we are devoted to making a difference in our student's lives." Two members of the Steelers family, Christy and Joey Porter Sr., were the recipients of the John E. McGrady Award for their commitment to the community. The Porters are the co-founders of the Jasmine Nyree Corporation, with campuses in Pittsburgh and Bakersfield, California, their hometown. The Jasmine Nyree Campus in Pittsburgh is a beacon of hope for adults with developmental issues, including Jasmine Porter, their daughter. It also is a beacon of hope for the Sheraden section of Pittsburgh where it's located, an area that is underserved and was in desperate need of the services now available. "We were completely shocked but honored by the award because the Rooney name is synonymous when you think of Pittsburgh," said Christy Porter. "The first thing you think of when someone says Pittsburgh, you say the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Rooney family. It's a major honor. To say that really is an understatement, but we're completely and totally honored to receive the award." Among the services being offered at the Jasmine Nyree Campus is a day program for adults 18-years and older with special needs, a service that isn't offered anywhere else in the City of Pittsburgh. It also offers medical services, a food court, after school programs for area kids and a learning center, working in conjunction with Pittsburgh Public Schools. And all of the services offered are free. "We opened the first facility 24 years ago for children and it's just a full circle moment," said Christy Porter. "Joey was drafted by the Steelers 25 years ago. I opened the first facility (in California) and then we moved to Pittsburgh and now open a facility in Pittsburgh for adults. I had no idea, 24 years later that over 10,000 families with children with special needs would have walked through our doors. And now we're doing the same for adults. I couldn't have ever imagined it or dreamt that we would be where we are today." Winning the award comes at a time of celebration for the Porters. Joey Porter Sr., a linebacker for the Steelers for eight seasons, is a member of the Steelers Hall of Honor Class of 2025 and will be inducted later this year. "The Rooney family will always hold a special place in my heart," said Christy Porter. "They drafted Joey in 1999, giving him the opportunity to live out his dream to be a Pittsburgh Steelers, and we know what that embodies. And now, all these years later, they've drafted our son. And our family has just really come full circle. It's truly an honor. "To have two generations connected to such a legendary organization, we are forever grateful and blessed to be part of the Pittsburgh Steelers family." There was nobody more fitting to be the recipient of the Bob Prince Award than Greg Brown. The award is named after Prince, the late Pittsburgh Pirates radio announcer and honors someone who embodies his enthusiasm for Pittsburgh sports and the community. Brown is in his 32nd year as a radio and television play-by-play announcer for the Pirates. Brown, who is an Emmy award winner, is known for sharing the phrases, 'Raise The Jolly Roger' after a Pirates win and 'Clear the deck, cannonball coming,' for a Pirates home run. Brown started with the Pirates as an intern in the promotions department in 1979, going on to work as a clubhouse manager at Pirate City. He also worked in the marketing, public relations and broadcasting departments. "I am so deeply humbled to be receiving such a prestigious award," said Brown. "Bob Prince was, obviously, an iconic, Hall of Fame broadcaster, but he was also an incredibly caring, compassionate man who donated his time and money to help others in the Pittsburgh community who were less fortunate, in particular, the Allegheny Valley School for Exceptional Children. There was no cause too big or too small that 'the Gunner' wouldn't embrace. To be associated with his name, along with all the other previous winners of the Bob Prince Award, is one of the most magnificent recognitions one could possibly receive. "Of course, ultimately, this award is about the person for whom the dinner is named - one of the greatest men to ever walk the face of the earth, 'The Chief,' Art Rooney. As a devout Catholic and Pittsburgh treasure, Mr. Rooney set the standard for those of us who have tried to make some positive impact in the community. He was so kind, so generous, so unselfish, so gracious and so humble. I certainly do not feel worthy to be given such an honor, but I am absolutely committed to continuing to try to make this great city and this region a better place in which to live, just as Mr. Rooney and Bob Prince did for so many years." KDKA-TV investigative reporter Andy Sheehan was the recipient of the Bill Burns Award, named after the late KDKA-TV news anchor and an award that stands for journalistic excellence. Sheehan joined KDKA-TV in 1992 after spending nine years as a reporter for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He is KDKA's lead investigative reporter, bringing in-depth, investigative stories to the Pittsburgh viewing market. "I'm extremely honored to be mentioned in the same breath as Bill Burns, who was the father of television news in Pittsburgh and at KDKA-TV where I've worked for the past three decades," said Sheehan. "He was a street reporter who rose to the top of his field believing that journalism and the pursuit of the truth was essential to functioning of a free society. "This was captured in his motto: 'The free press is the oil in the machine of democracy.' I've only wanted to be a link in the chain, holding the powerful accountable, watching the public's purse and giving a voice to people who don't have a seat at the table." In addition, John Moffett received the Nick Cardello Award for his volunteer work with CYA West Deer Center.

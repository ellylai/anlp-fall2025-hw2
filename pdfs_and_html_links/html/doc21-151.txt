KENNETH GAINWELL Running Back No Jaylen Warren. No time to devise a plan because the injury happened late in the week. And no running game to speak of through the first three weeks of the season. No problem. Kenneth Gainwell rushed for 99 yards on 19 carries (5.2 average) and scored 2 touchdowns; he also caught 6 passes for 35 yards to finish with 134 yards from scrimmage in a 24-21 victory over Minnesota in the first NFL regular season game played in Ireland. He is the Steelers Digest Player of the Week. Also considered were DeShon Elliott, who had 6 tackles, 1 sack, 2 hits on the QB, 1 interception, 2 passes defensed, and 1 forced fumble; Nick Herbig, who had 5 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and 3 hits on the QB; DK Metcalf, who caught 5 passes for 126 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown; Aaron Rodgers, who completed 18-of-22 (81.8 percent) for 200 yards, with 1 touchdown, 0 interceptions, and a rating of 119.7; Patrick Queen, who had 11 tackles, 3 of which were tackles for loss, and 1 sack; T.J. Watt, who had 5 tackles, 1 sack, 1 interception, and 2 hits on the QB; Payton Wilson, who had 13 tackles, one of which was a great effort in which he caught Jordan Addison from behind on an 81-yard catch-and-run that forced the Vikings to burn a minute off the game clock in the fourth quarter before getting the touchdown; and Keeanu Benton, who had 4 tackles, and 1.5 sacks.

The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when GeneralJohn Forbesand his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesmanWilliam Pitt the Elder. The British builtFort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of theOhio. Settlers began arriving afterNative Americanforces led by Ottawa chiefPontiacwere defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundarydisputewas ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following theAmerican Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.1 of 2William C.

Ablast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron andsteelindustry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, openedvitalmarkets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.Britannica QuizGuess the City by Its River QuizAfter theAmerican Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such asAndrew Carnegie,Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and theAmerican Federation of Laborwas born there in 1881.map of Pittsburgh, c. 1900Map of Pittsburgh (c. 1900), from the 10th edition ofEncyclopædia Britannica.(more)By 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated throughWorld War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The populationcrestedat more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic andpopulation growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity bynuclear power.The contemporary cityBy the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste byunemployment, becoming a symbol of thenotoriousRust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking andmanufacturingonce thrived beforesuccumbingto widespread unemployment andpoverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and theservice sectorbecame increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.Duquesne UniversityStudent Union, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh.(more)Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L.

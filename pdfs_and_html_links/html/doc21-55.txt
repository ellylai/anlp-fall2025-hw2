Sunday, September 28 Home sweet home...kind of: Croke Park will feel like Acrisure Stadium when the Steelers host the Minnesota Vikings in the first ever NFL regular season game in Ireland today. With the Steelers being the home team, game presentation elements that are utilized at Acrisure Stadium will be part of pregame and in-game content. And that includes playing 'Renegade' during the game. "That will be a first," said Dan Rooney, the Steelers Vice President of Business Development and Strategy. "We've done a few watch parties at Croke Park where we've played 'Renegade.' But to have a game taking place on the pitch of Croke Park, and for Renegade to come on, it's going to be a cool moment for Steelers Nation." The Steelers played a preseason game at Croke Park in 1997, but this time around, it's a completely different feeling. "Croke Park is a special place in Ireland and to the Irish sporting culture," said Rooney. "The fact that they are opening their doors to NFL football yet again, for a regular season game this time around, is special. "It's really amazing that we're hosting a game there against the Minnesota Vikings. It's a massive stadium. We believe it will be a packed house. We believe we'll see a lot of black and gold in the stands. "So, it's going to be a special day in Steelers history and a special day in Irish history as well."

Saturday, September 27 NFL a hit in Ireland: Steelers President Art Rooney II and Hall of Fame running back Jerome Bettis spoke as part of a panel at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's Town Hall in Dublin on Saturday. The Town Hall, an event the commissioner normally hosts at NFL International events, hit on a wide range of topics, from the growing global market to fan support in cities around the globe, and everything in between. Playing a regular season game in Ireland was a long-time dream of late Steelers chairman and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney, whose family is from Newry, Northern Ireland. "The connection between the Steelers and Ireland and the NFL is so strong that it was a natural choice to have the Steelers here," said Goodell. "I know Dan will be smiling down on all of us." The Town Hall was held in advance of Sunday's Steelers game against the Minnesota Vikings at Croke Park, a game that brings back special memories for the organization. The Steelers played in a preseason game in Croke Park in 1997, defeating the Chicago Bears. "It was a great trip," said Art Rooney II. "We were very excited about bringing the team over there to play. I think the interesting thing about it, compared to coming back over now to play a game, I would say the Irish people had only a vague awareness of what American football was then. They didn't really understand it very well. "Of course, they have great sports of their own. Hurling and Gaelic football are the big sports over there. So, it was hard for American football to kind of edge some of those sports out of the headlines. "But today, the excitement about the Steelers coming to Ireland is amazing. It was a great start back in '97, but it's amazing what it is now today compared to then." Bettis played in the game and has fond memories of his first trip to Ireland. "It means a lot that the Steelers are playing a regular season game here," said Bettis. "This has been a long time coming to have a regular season game In Ireland. "Obviously, we had the preseason game here. We were able to go and represent the NFL, we represented the Rooney family extremely well in terms of the Steelers. "So, to have an opportunity to come back here with the organization and for the team to play a regular season game here, I think it's really significant. "I believe it's the only right team to be here. The Rooney family, they've done so much in representing their heritage, being from Ireland, wanting to do so much for the country, so much so that Mr. (Dan) Rooney was the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. It shows you the commitment that they have made to the birthplace of their family. "So, it's only fitting that the Steelers get an opportunity to represent the NFL in the first regular season game in Ireland." While it was a preseason game in 1997, there was still a lot on the line. Especially for the Steelers. The winning team received a Waterford Crystal trophy, with a shamrock base, and it was a trophy Dan Rooney's wife, Patricia, took a liking to when she first saw it. "There was a beautiful Waterford Crystal trophy that was created to be presented to the winner of the game," said Rooney. "My mother saw the trophy and started telling (Coach) Bill Cowher how great it would be to have that trophy. And it's a beautiful trophy. "When Bill got wind of what the game meant, and what winning that trophy would mean to my mother, he said he had to put in a different game plan than you normally would for a preseason game. "We put it in the trophy case here. It's still in a trophy case today." And he wasn't joking about the game plan changing. In a normal preseason game, the starters either don't play, or see very limited play time. That wasn't the case in Dublin. The Steelers starters all played, with Bettis scoring the game's first touchdown on a three-yard run. "I think it had a little bit more meaning," said Bettis. "Obviously, because you want to come away with the win. But I remember the practices were really significant in terms of us having a focus. They were pretty physical, especially practicing against the Bears. "I think it all led to a situation where we knew we wanted to win that football game." Bettis has plenty of other great memories from the trip, which was a week-long visit, including visiting some local establishments in Dublin "What sticks out to me was me going into a neighborhood pub and having a pint," said a smiling Bettis. "Obviously, the first time doing that and being in a foreign country, you hear stories about the pubs and that kind of thing. So, it was just a great experience. "It was very welcoming. The people of Ireland are really what I remember. I think that's part of what I'll take with me in terms of the memory of the last one. They treated everyone so well, including my family. My parents and my grandmother came on the trip in 1997. "It was fun to have them there because obviously these experiences are memories for a lifetime. I think every player is going to remember this game, and if their family came it's a shared experience." That shared experience is the dream come true for Dan Rooney, and his son and the entire organization are pleased that it is now a reality. "The fact that the game is in Ireland, a regular season game after all these years is something that we probably were never sure that it would actually happen," said Art Rooney. "Obviously, there are bigger countries in the world that the league could have taken the game to. And so fair to say, we lobbied pretty hard to get this game in Ireland and it took a few years for it to happen. "I think even the league is a little surprised at the demand for tickets and the attention the game is getting. So, it's great that we're able to be here and have our team here and bring something to Ireland. "My father would have the biggest smile on his face, as you can imagine. And my mother, they would really love seeing this happen. The many years they put into developing friends, and the Irish relationship was important. "I'm sure they'll be looking down on this game and enjoying it very much." Bringing flag football to Ireland: The NFL hosted a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland residence in Phoenix Park on Saturday, an opportunity for approximately 40 youth from area schools to take part in a five-on-five NFL Flag Football Tournament. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Steelers President Art Rooney II and Steelers Vice President of Business Development and Strategy were in attendance for the fun-filled afternoon. Ben Roethlisberger, Maurkice Pouncey and Ike Taylor were all on hand to provide instruction and encouragement for the youth. Current U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, Edward Walsh, opened the residence for the event, a throwback to some of the events that were held there when late Steelers chairman Dan Rooney Sr. was U.S. Ambassador to Ireland from 2009-2012. Walsh welcomed the group, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also spoke, talking about the growth of flag football in Ireland. The NFL and American Football Ireland launched an NFL Flag pilot program in 2024. That was expanded in 2025 when NFL Flag starter kits were delivered to more than 900 post-primary schools on the island of Ireland for students ages 12-16. Teachers also received free online educational resources for the classrooms, as well as training courses. Roethlisberger had a good time working with the kids and taking in the overall atmosphere. "It's really cool because it's a sport and a game that I was blessed to play for so long," said Roethlisberger. "God blessed me with the ability to play it. All the benefits, friendships and relationships that came from my years of playing football were special. "So, if I can just pass on a little bit of that love to a kid and they take it up and enjoy it, then it makes it all worth it." Growing youth football on all levels and in every market is something the Steelers are focused on. "It's one thing to watch American football on television, and it's an incredibly entertaining sport with great athletes and great stars," said Dan Rooney. "But to learn our game at the grassroots level, there's no deeper fandom and passion that comes from really understanding the game from a participation level, and we love our sport so much. "It's such a joy to bring it to Ireland and apply it to the great athletes over there who are skilled in Gaelic football, hurling or rugby. These are great athletes that play the sports they love. When we introduce American football, they see why it's such a popular sport in the U.S. "Any time we've held a camp over in Ireland, by the end of the camp, we see the youth smiling and having an absolute blast." Rooney said having the camp at the Ambassador's residence brings back great memories of Fourth of July flag football games his grandfather hosted there when he was the U.S. Ambassador. "I was hoping when the Ireland game became a reality, when we were thinking through the events of the week, in the back of my mind I thought it would be neat to do something American football related at the at the Ambassador's residence because of the cool tradition my grandfather started while he was Ambassador," said Rooney. "The famous Fourth of July flag football games that used to get played were special. Being able to do this, bring some of our alumni here and celebrate the game of American football on this property and continue to teach our game to the Irish, it's really great. "We're thrilled that the Ambassador opened his doors to us." Roethlisberger visited Dublin for one of the Fourth of July flag football games during Ambassador Rooney's tenure, and coming back to take part in the flag football clinic touches his heart. "It's nostalgic," said Roethlisberger. "Being here the last time with Mr. Rooney and then being here now is sentimental. It's awesome to be part of something at this location where Mr. Rooney lived. It really is special. "I remember the game when I was here for the Fourth of July. It was incredibly special to see all the festivities that were put on, how much the people were enjoying us being there and being a part of it. You could just see the love and passion that they have." Roethlisberger, who had a strong relationship with Ambassador Rooney, said the most important thing of the week is that Rooney's dream of a regular season game in Ireland is coming true. "The only thing that obviously would have made it better was him being here on this earth," said Roethlisberger. "I know he's watching in heaven, but it'd only be better if he was here. "But the cool thing about it is it's his legacy. It's his son, Art, and his grandson, Dan, who are a part of it. I am sure at some point we will all toast Mr. Rooney." Special memories: There aren't many former NFL players who can say both they and their son will have played in an NFL game in Ireland. Actually, there is only one combination who can say that. Mark Bruener, the former Steelers tight end and current Steelers scout, and his son, Steelers rookie linebacker Carson Bruener, are the only ones who have those bragging rights. Mark Bruener played in the Steelers preseason game at historic Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland in 1997 against the Chicago Bears, and on Sunday, Carson Bruener will play in the first regular season NFL game in Ireland, also at Croke Park, when the Steelers take on the Minnesota Vikings. "It's so ironic, and it's so crazy how things are coming full circle," said Mark Bruener. "It's surreal that things I did early in my career, my son is basically replicating. When the Dublin game was announced, I was like man this is incredible. I thought how cool it would be for me to be able to go back for that. "And then as the spring went on, and Carson got drafted by the team, I was thinking it would be really cool if he made the team so he could go play in that game. Well, then he makes the team. "And now he's literally going to be playing on the same field that I played on in Ireland almost 30 years prior as a Steeler in the early part of his career. "It's really crazy just how parallel it is." Bruener can't wait to be at Croke Park on Sunday afternoon to watch his son and the entire team, something that is bringing back fond memories of the game in 1997. It was a more relaxed atmosphere for the players then since it was a preseason game, an opportunity to see the sights, as well as play a game. "One of the things about the trip was first of all, it was in the preseason, and we were so excited as players because back then we had two a day practices and the schedule only permitted one single practice in Ireland," recalled Bruener. "So, the players were all jazzed because we basically got a little bit of extra reprieve from all the practices we had. "Then there was the (Bears Coach) Dave Wannstedt and Bill Cowher comparison, because Dave was from Pennsylvania just like Bill. So, those types of things were kind of brought up and talked about by the players. "I also loved seeing the town, the cobblestone streets and sidewalks. I thought that was something that really stood out. The people were extremely friendly, very welcoming. And I think probably because of the Rooney family and following and being Irish, we had a much larger contingency of Steeler fans there, at least it appeared to, than Chicago Bears fans. "So, those are things that really kind of struck me and it's something that I remember." While there was a lot of excitement for the preseason game, Bruener is amazing how the interest in the NFL has grown internationally. "The NFL has done an amazing job of promoting American football internationally with the numerous games," said Bruener. "If fans abroad don't know the rules of American football, then that's our job to teach them so the game can continue to grow there. And there is an interest in American football. The game is growing, and it's not by accident. It's an honest effort and a very good effort by the NFL and the individual teams to allow the game to grow internationally. "The NFL used to host just one international game. Now there's several international games that are hosted and played all over. "And yet, when we were in Ireland in 1997, you would see a potpourri of NFL jerseys in the stands. It was Steelers vs. Bears when we were there, but you would still jerseys for other teams. Now you're actually seeing more of the corresponding teams that are playing being represented by the fans. That shows the loyalty and the allegiance that you're getting with the fans internationally to the American football teams." And there is one thing Bruener expects to see plenty of on Sunday, and that is Steelers jerseys. "I expect those Terrible Towels to be filling that stadium," said Bruener. "That is Steelers Nation. We talk about how Steelers Nation travels across the country in the United States. I expect Steelers Nation to be loud and proud on game day in Dublin, Ireland, several thousand miles away from Pittsburgh. I'm excited about it." The fact that Sunday's game is a home game for the Steelers, which will feature different aspects straight from Acrisure Stadium, excites Bruener even more. "I think there might be times throughout the game when you hear Renegade, and you're seeing the home production, where people might even forget that we're in Dublin," said Bruener. "People might think we're at Acrisure Stadium. It's going to be electric." Friday, September 26 Meet and Greet: Hall of Fame running back Jerome Bettis had an opportunity to meet Steelers fans on Saturday during an appearance at the Steelers Pro Shop in Dublin, Ireland. Bettis enjoyed the opportunity to greet local fans, as well as those who traveled from the United States for the game. "It was a great opportunity to meet the local fans and really create an impact on them," said Bettis. "We know how many people love the Steelers and the organization from America, but to have an opportunity to make an impression on some Irish fans, that was really special too."

And the most important thing for him is he is representing the Steelers, the team that drafted him in the second round of the 1989 NFL Draft, and he went on to play 10 years for. "I thank my blessings to be a part of the Steelers organization for so long, and to still be thought about is really special," said Lake. "It shows the kind of organization and the kind of people that are associated with the organization, the Rooney family and all involved. "I couldn't have asked for anything better out of an NFL career. The people I played with years ago, I'm still in communication with so it's been a lasting great relationship. "It means a lot to be thought of and to be a part of this trip to Ireland." Lake has always known Steelers fans are plentiful across the United States, but he is once again seeing first-hand that Steelers Nation goes well beyond the borders of the United States, with black and gold visible all over Ireland. "It's just is a credit to the organization to be able to tap into the fan base everywhere," said Lake. "Over the years, being with the Steelers and traveling around the world, you see it. Last year I went to Mexico as part of a group that went there to watch a game with some Mexican fans. And when I was a player, we went to Montreal, Ireland, Spain and Japan. "I realized that the Steeler fans travel well and it's not just fans that are from Pittsburgh that come to the home games, it is worldwide. "I think it's ultimately about the quality of the organization and it's also a history of winning. That's what people want to be associated with." Lake mentioned some of those international games he was a part of, and that included the Steelers preseason game against the Chicago Bears in Ireland in 1997. He has great memories from his first visit to Ireland, as well as the way the game turned from a normal preseason game to a competitive game when Patricia Rooney, the wife of Steelers chairman Dan Rooney Sr., told him she loved the Waterford crystal trophy the winner was going to receive, and the goal quickly became to win the game for that. "We had some heated practices (against the Bears)," shared Lake. "That's one thing I remember. There were scuffles breaking out. It was high intensity leading up to the game. So, the game was just the icing on the cake in terms of competitiveness. And so that's one thing that I do remember." Lake also remembers how warm the people of Dublin were then, something he still sees today. "The first time we were here, it was amazing," recalled Lake. "Mr. Rooney's vision was for it to be a special event and to be a memorable event and to see Ireland, not just from hotel to locker room to field, but to really see and go out and mingle amongst the people of Ireland, whether it was shopping or sightseeing or golfing. They really made it special. "To come back and kind of relive some of the memories that happened over in Ireland is just wonderful. I think about Mr. Rooney, and what this would mean for him, and to be invited over here to participate is really special." One of the visions of Dan Rooney was to expand the game to new audiences, something that has been passed down to his son, Steelers President Art Rooney II, and his grandson, Steelers Vice President Dan Rooney. Lake takes great pride in his role in helping with that vision. "It's a fabulous game," said Lake. "I think if you were to ask any of my teammates, or anyone who's ever played football, would they play football again, the vast majority without hesitation would say yes. The game provides excitement. It provides a deep sense of competition. "For young kids who are throwing the football or being chased and whether it's flag football or tackle football, there's just something that you can't get by playing video games that you can get playing football. Once you get out there with the football in your hand and you're playing with your friends, it's really exciting. "That level of interest and excitement is not just contained within the United States. I think any kid around the world would enjoy that, and I think that's what's happened and we are seeing that here in Ireland."

(Ben McShane / Pittsburgh Steelers) Ben McShane/Pittsburgh Steelers Advertising This Ad will close in 3 Thursday, September 25 Youth football clinic a hit: One of the first activities the Steelers took part in during their time in Ireland was a youth flag football clinic in Belfast, Northern Ireland. "We want to be Ireland's team and that means the whole island of Ireland," said Steelers President Art Rooney II. "We hope and think we have fans in Northern Ireland. We're happy to have had the chance to go up there and visit while we're over here." The camp, which was attended by Steelers legends, was held at Colin Glen Leisure Entrance for kids 11-15. "The Steelers mission with American football on the island of Ireland has always been about the entire island, so it was really important for us to travel to Northern Ireland, to Belfast, to hold this youth football camp," said Dan Rooney, the Steelers Vice President of Business Development and Strategy. "It is special to have Steelers alumni teach American football to the children of Belfast and other areas of Northern Ireland. "We're most comfortable on a football field, so being able to teach the game we love to the youth of the island of Ireland is important." Steelers legends Jerome Bettis, Max Starks and Ike Taylor were handling the instruction, enjoying the experience immensely. "This was an opportunity for these kids to fall in love with the game," said Bettis. "The reason I know that is that's when I fell in love with the game when I was 15 years old at a football camp. "So, I know it's real. I know the possibility is there. The key was we made sure that we gave them the experience that they won't ever forget." Many kids in Northern Ireland have never been exposed to American football up close, and that was a fun challenge for Bettis and company. "They were really listening to instruction because they don't know the game, which is a beautiful thing," said Bettis. "They were hungry for instruction. They were listening, they were attentive and that's always the best audience. We had a blank slate in terms of the kids' knowledge and what we were asking of them." Starks remembers the passion late Steelers chairman and United States Ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney Sr. had when it came to hosting youth football camps in Ireland, so the opportunity to take part in this one was something he cherished. "It's the ultimate honor," said Starks. "I think about back to when Mr. Dan Rooney was appointed Ambassador to Ireland while I was playing. And his dream was to bring American football camps to Ireland while he was there. "Now, we didn't get to do that to the extent that he wanted while he was alive. I remember him asking, 'Hey, Max, would you ever be interested in doing that?' I said, 'Absolutely, sir.' That would be my honor and my pleasure. "So, to realize that request all these years later and still be able to make good on that promise. It just means the world to me because I thought the world of Mr. Rooney. "To be able to do this kind of in his honor and his family's honor is a real special blessing."

Bringing the legends is something the team wanted to do so fans traveling from the Unites States as well as those in Dublin have an opportunity to interact with them and learn more about the team from them. "It's important to us to be able to involve our Steelers alumni in such a special trip like this," said Dan Rooney, the Steelers Vice President of Business Development and Strategy. "The names traveling over, we have Hall of Famers coming over, we have Steelers Hall of Honor members coming over to engage with Steelers Nation, Irish NFL fans, and just the Irish people in general. "We have a full slate of events that if you're a Steelers fan, or an NFL fan, and want to come by one of these Steelers events, you're going to probably run into a Steelers' alumni that you can meet and hear from. "So, it's really cool for us to bring our alumni over and help make this game as special as it's going to be." The plan is for the team to bring several players who took part in the 1997 preseason game in Ireland, when the Steelers defeated the Chicago Bears. It will be an opportunity for them to share and relive what it was like to play in Ireland, while also enjoying the excitement surrounding this year's game. "For us to bring those guys that have memories of the 1997 preseason game is special," said Rooney. "So, they're going to come over and be able to tell stories of that preseason game and the trip that Coach (Bill) Cowher and my grandfather (Dan Rooney Sr.) led back in 97. "And they're going to remember those days and see how much the passion for American football has come alive in Ireland." Wednesday, September 24 A tour like no other: The final day of the Terrible Towel Tour began in County Sligo, known for it's rugged landscape and the area that captured the heart of poet and Nobel Laureate, WB Yates, who christened it 'the land of heart's desire.' A walk on the beach in Strandhill, the jewel of the Wild Atlantic Way's surf coast, provided an amazing scenic respite amid a historic backdrop. Northern Ireland was the next destination, which began in Derry/Londonderry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland. While the area is surrounded by history and coastal landscape, it also offers the modern touches of a bustling area further inland. While in the region, the group met with players and management from Derry City Football Club on a visit to Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium. Starks took part in a jersey swap with Derry City FC, an opportunity to connect and teach each other a little about their respective sports. Before departing, the group went on a guided tour of City Centre, which is the compact and walkable heart of the area. It is known for the 17th century city walls, as well as modern waterfront attractions such as the Peace Bridge. The group then departed for Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the Steelers will host a youth football camp, and then the Rooney's home of Newry, where activities are planned on Thursday. "Knowing the rich history of Ireland, and then you mix that with the Steelers organization and the ownership at the top, and their origins, it's incredible," said Starks. "Thinking about places like Newry, where 'The Chief' (Art Rooney Sr.) is from. "Being able to go see that, do a tour that ends in Belfast for the football camp is amazing." Josh Veon/Pittsburgh Steelers Josh Veon/Pittsburgh Steelers Josh Veon/Pittsburgh Steelers Josh Veon/Pittsburgh Steelers Tuesday, September 23 The journey continues: Day two of the Terrible Towel Tour, sponsored by took the group to Limerick, where the main stop was at the University of Limerick. While there, Starks and company visited with members of the Munster Rugby team, who are part of the Irish Rugby Football Union, and have their performance center on the campus. One of the most beautiful stops along the tour was at the Cliffs of Moher, which tower over the rugged West Clare coast, with spectacular views of the Wild Atlantic Ocean and Aran Islands in Galway Bay. The Cliffs of Moher are one of Irelands most visited attractions and offer a beauty that is hard to beat. "There are so many beautiful parts of Ireland that I hope Steelers Nation will get to be exposed to on our journey," said Starks. "I'm absolutely loving it. It has been a fantastic trip." After the breathtaking views, it was back on the road to Gort, a market town in County Galway, where they visited Harte's Pub. The quintessential Irish pub is owned by a Steelers fan, offering a warm welcome for the group. The group concluded the tour with a stop in Galway City. There they visited the Spanish Arch, one of Galway's gems that dates back to pre-medieval times. The Arch is located where the river meets the sea, making it a perfect stop for a relaxing visit. Other stops in Galway included Shop Street, the primary pedestrian shopping street that is known for unique shops, pubs and a lively atmosphere. The group also visited Eyre Square in the heart of Galway City, which is officially known as John F. Kennedy Memorial Park. "It's so important to do this, because Ireland has a rich tradition in Gaelic football and they are fans of American football," said Starks. "I have an opportunity to spread the interest and love in American football even further as we reach the corner of the island and figure out what people know. "But at the end of the day, as long as you have a Terrible Towel, you'll always be good anywhere. It's your football passport, so to speak. "I love engaging with new fans, creating new fans and of course reinforcing the fans that we already have."

Monday, September 21 Terrible Towel Tour is underway: A contingent from the Steelers has already touched down in Ireland, and are making their way across the island, visiting various cities as part of a Terrible Towel Tour, presented by Aer Lingus. Throughout the multi-day tour, which touches all parts of Ireland, the group is stopping along the way and visiting with local celebrities and dignitaries, in a Steelers branded Terrible Towel van. The main reason for the tour is to visit the different areas of Ireland, something late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney Sr. did while he was the United States Ambassador to Ireland and visited every county. The trip is also an opportunity to learn more about the Irish culture, while also distributing Terrible Towels to the locals in advance of Sunday's game against the Minnesota Vikings at Croke Park. Led by Max Starks, the former offensive lineman and two-time Super Bowl champion, getting the towels twirling along the route was first and foremost. "I have to teach the twirl. That's the first thing," said Starks. "It's about getting a group together. It's almost like a yoga class. Warm up the elbow, get the shoulder rotator cuff going, and then you make sure you have a good grip on the towel. "You have to pick a corner to hold the towel. You have a lucky corner or whatever corner. You bunch it up and then you just make sure that twirl is consistent. Almost like a lasso. You got to get it done." The tour began in Dublin, which will be the main point of activity for Steelers Nation this week. Starks stopped by the Steelers Pro Shop in Dublin to pick up a supply of Terrible Towels to take along with him on the tour. "It's amazing," said Starks. "You would love to say it's a dream come true, but I don't even think I could have that dream. So, it's something of fantasy to be able to do this." The next stop on the first day of the tour was in Kilkenny, where the group visited the Kilkenny Castle. The Castle was founded after the Norman conquest of Ireland and rebuilt and adapted to suit 'changing circumstances and uses' over a period of 800 years. The castle, which is open to visitors, is a Victorian remodeling of the 13th century defensive Castle. It was then on to Killarney for the final stop of the day, where they met and toured the city with Gaelic football player Paudie Clifford. Clifford, a lifelong Steelers fan, announced one of the Steelers draft picks in 2024 from a draft party in Ireland and was the perfect tour guide.

Four blocks away and 50 years apart from KST, Curator Harrison Apple showcases H.O.T. and the Pittsburgh Queer History Project’s photo archive, which includes documentation of early queer, trans, and performers of color who dominated the disco era. While the physical architecture has long been demolished, Calendar Girls in the House of Tilden celebrates the celebrity at work behind the guarded door on Penn Avenue.

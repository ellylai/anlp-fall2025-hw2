Workshops for Educators Our signature program is a unique, fun, and stimulating professional learning opportunity for teachers of all grade levels in all content areas. Workshop topics include the five 2025–2026 season operas plus additional arts integration materials so that teachers have additional resources to use in their classes. Each workshop is recorded so that participants can attend live or at a later time. We include live presentations and/or performances by guest artists. And, we provide some of the workshop materials in advance for participants to explore at their convenience, so the actual “live” workshop time is short and engaging. We offer a total of six 1.5 hour workshops on Saturday mornings from 10:30 am–12:00 pm via Zoom, with a one hour networking time afterwards, plus one in-person set tour at the Bitz Opera Factory. There is no cost to attend the workshop. Pre-registration is required a week in advance by emailing: megan@pittsburghopera.org 2025-26 WORKSHOP FOR EDUCATORS SEASON THEME: Technical Aspects of Opera Production ZOOM: #1      September 27, 2025 La bohème #2      November 1, 2025 Fellow Travelers #3      December 6, 2025         Technical Aspects of Opera Production #4      January 10, 2026 Curlew River #5      February 14, 2026 Time to Act #6      March 28, 2026 Falstaff IN PERSON: #7      Sunday, April 12, 2026 Falstaff Set Tour workshop OPERA ACADEMY A stimulating and intensive program, Opera Academy is a year-long professional learning experience designed to immerse educators into the world of opera.

Opera Academy members receive a full season subscription, seven workshops, and a student performance or Opera Trunk presentation. In return, Opera Academy members document how they use opera in their classes. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.

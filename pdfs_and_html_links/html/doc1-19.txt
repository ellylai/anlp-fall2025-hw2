She is a strong advocate for her patients. remove add Meet Sadie Mohrbacher! Sadie Mohrbacherâs career as a trauma bedside nurse began with her own traumatic accident when she was 16 years old. Sadie, who drove racecars as a teen, and her father got in a car accident while driving to the racetrack one weekend. She suffered serious injuries and was transported by helicopter to UPMC Childrenâs Hospital of Pittsburgh. One of her nurses, Adam, helped her through the traumatic experience. âAdam was important to me,â says Sadie, BSN, RN, professional staff nurse, Trauma/General Surgery, UPMC Presbyterian. âHe made me feel like my world wasn't ending at 16. Which would be dramatic, but that's how I felt. Adam really made me feel like everything was going to be OK.â Years later, Sadie pays the care Adam gave her forward. For providing comforting care to patients experiencing trauma, she is the UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero Spotlight. Sadie works in unit 12D at UPMC Presbyterian, caring for patients who have gone through trauma like car accidents, shootings, overdoses, and more. UPMC Presbyterian is a level 1 trauma center, certified to treat the most serious trauma cases. âI love the adrenaline and the fast pace of my specific area â coming out every day, not having any idea what to expect,â Sadie says. âYou could have somebody with an arm or leg missing. You could have somebody whoâs there for chronic headaches. It's the adrenaline of not knowing what lays beyond those doors.â Sadie works 12-hour shifts, helping patients at the bedside. She also works as a charge nurse, performing responsibilities like assigning patients and assisting fellow nurses. âSadie goes above and beyond the call of her nursing duties,â says Paula Hobbs, MSN, RN, CMSRN, CSN, unit director, Trauma/General Surgery, UPMC Presbyterian. âShe is a team player and is also willing to help the team in any way that she can. She makes sure that she goes the extra mile for patients and their families.â Paula says Sadie also mentors and teaches new staff. She is also often shadowed by nursing students, either for an entire semester or for single shifts. âI have always told my management that I have a big heart for educating,â Sadie says. As a bedside nurse, Sadie draws on her own experience as a teenager. She says she often puts herself in her patientsâ shoes to think about how to comfort them. âOften, you can find Sadie talking with families and patients about their hospital stay, and when patients and families are upset, she makes sure that she finds a way to comfort them,â Paula says. âSadie will often sit with the patient to explain their next steps in their care and to listen to their concerns. She is a strong advocate for her patients. âSadie is the kind of nurse that everyone would want to have during their hospital stay.â Sadie says the pedal-to-the-metal nature of trauma nursing matches with her previous âadrenaline junkie behavior of racing cars.â However, what she enjoys most about her job is helping patients, whether it be medically or emotionally. âI have told many people straight out: I've been in your shoes,â she says. âI have been the person that is fear-struck, not knowing what the future holds. I've been the person that cried myself to sleep every night in the hospital and just wanted to go home. âBut I'm also the person that got through that 10 years ago, and I'm the person who now helps people and can tell you firsthand that you're going to make it, you're going to get through this, youâre going to get stronger, you're going to go home.â Michelle Baker Although her job comes with challenges, Michelle says the people she works with keep her coming back every day. âIt truly is the people,â she says. âWe have a pretty tight-knit department, and itâs what keeps me coming back.â remove add Meet Michelle Baker! Through nearly three decades in diagnostic radiology at UPMC Shadyside, Michelle Baker, RT(R), has seen many things change. One thing that hasnât is the teamwork that exists within the hospital. âThe practitioners that we have, theyâve been here a long time,â says Michelle, supervisor of diagnostic radiology at UPMC Shadyside. âWe have good rapport with them. âEverybody just works together. Itâs kind of refreshing. Everybody in my department, everybody just helps each other.â As a former technologist who rose to the role of supervisor, Michelle plays a crucial role in keeping the teamwork going. She is this monthâs UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero Spotlight recipient. Michelle will celebrate her 30th anniversary at UPMC Shadyside next year. She began working at the hospital as a student technologist and moved all the way up the ladder, becoming supervisor about 13 years ago. âI like taking care of people,â she says. âI went right out of high school right into the program, and I just never left. I love the people I work with. Thereâs a core group that still is here, and theyâve been here for a long time, and we work well together.â In her current role, Michelle oversees the Diagnostic Radiology Department, which is responsible for x-rays within the hospital. In addition to her administrative responsibilities, she also helps with direct patient care. She typically assists physicians on lumbar punctures, setting up the patients and running the equipment. Michelle believes her own experience as a technologist helps her connect with her staff. She says patience is one of her biggest strengths, helping her to adapt to the changes and challenges that come with her job. âA lot has changed in 30 years with everything,â she says. âWith technology, when I started, we ran films. Now, everythingâs digital. Itâs just adapting to all the changes, adapting to all the different students that we see come through. I just enjoy it.â The technology is the biggest change that Michelle has seen in her time in medicine. âWhen I first started, we had 30, 40, 50 portable (x-rays) that you would go up to do,â she says. âYouâd have to take the cassettes, youâd have to run them, youâd have to take some and hang them for the radiologist to look at. âNow, you just shoot the film and it goes right to the doctor. Everything is streamlined. Itâs simpler.â Although her job comes with challenges, Michelle says the people she works with keep her coming back every day. âIt truly is the people,â she says. âWe have a pretty tight-knit department, and itâs what keeps me coming back.â Jermaine Harris Jermaine Harris takes pride in being reliable.

Jermaine Harris takes pride in being reliable. He arrives on time for every shift, ready to work. âI just love to do my job,â says Jermaine, a compact operator at UPMC McKeesport. âIâll help anybody if they need help.â For his day-to-day dependability, Jermaine is this monthâs UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero. Jermaine works in UPMC McKeesportâs Environmental Services (EVS) Department. He operates the trash compactor, disposing of trash and biohazard waste from the entire hospital. âIt is his job to provide a clean, free environment for the hospital and to make sure everything is being disposed of properly and within the guidelines of the hospital,â says Amy Nagy, supervisor, UPMC McKeesport Environmental Services. But his work goes beyond that. Jermaine is willing to step in wherever heâs needed. âYou donât have to ask me â I just do it,â he says. âIf I see anything that needs to be done, I just do it. Thatâs who I am. âIf thereâs something on the floor, I pick it up. If it needs to be mopped, I take care of it. I donât ask anyone if I need to; I just do it myself.â Originally from New Orleans, La., Jermaine will celebrate his 10-year anniversary at UPMC in August. Before coming to UPMC, he worked in the casino business âfor a long time.â âI said, âI want to change my scenery and work in the hospital,ââ he says. âIâve been here ever since. âI traveled the world already. I was just trying to do something so I didnât have to travel so much and do something else. This is a good job.â Environmental Services provides a crucial resource to the hospital, helping to ensure a clean, safe, and welcoming environment for patients, visitors, and staff. âWe take care of everybody in the hospital,â Jermaine says. âAny needs you need, we take care of it. Cleaning, we can do that. Thatâs why I love it so much. Weâre helping each other out.â Amy describes Jermaine as âvery thoughtful, dependable, respectful, and kind.â âJermaine altogether is an amazing employee,â she says. âEvery task given, he always has a positive attitude. Heâs always willing to help the EVS management team along with his co-workers. Over the years, he has gone out of his way for his co-workers, such as providing transportation for the staff members that had their vehicle at the repair shop.â Jermaine has found a home at UPMC McKeesport. âThe people are nice,â he says. âYou learn new things every day. Every day brings new challenges and new things. Thatâs what I like about it.â Chin Bello Chin Bello says people call her crazy sometimes because sheâs always on the move. âI like to do things,â Chin says. âI canât sit still. Even at home, itâs the same thing. I canât sit still. I have to do something.â That relentless energy comes in handy in her job as a housekeeper in UPMC Eastâs Environmental Services Department. remove add Meet Chin Bello! Chin Bello says people call her crazy sometimes because sheâs always on the move. âI like to do things,â Chin says. âI canât sit still. Even at home, itâs the same thing. I canât sit still. I have to do something.â That relentless energy comes in handy in her job as a housekeeper in UPMC Eastâs Environmental Services Department. For her diligence in her work, Chin is this monthâs recipient of the UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero Spotlight. Chin works in UPMC Eastâs intensive care unit (ICU), responsible for cleaning the 16 patient rooms and other parts of the unit. âI make sure everythingâs clean for the patients and the patientsâ families every day,â she says. John Merkt, the operations manager for Environmental Services and Patient Transport at UPMC East, says Chin âtakes great prideâ in the cleanliness of the ICU. The unit ranks above the 90th percentile for cleanliness in the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. âShe ensures that the ICU rooms and unit are cleaned daily,â John says. âShe ensures that after patients are discharged or transferred out of the unit, the rooms are thoroughly cleaned and prepared for the next patients coming into the unit. âThis is extremely important because the ICU patients are usually the most specialized care patients in our hospital, with advanced monitoring, treatment, and teams of specialists.â Originally from Thailand, Chin has worked for UPMC since 2021. Before coming to UPMC, she worked as a hibachi chef at a restaurant in Pittsburghâs Waterfront neighborhood. She still put her cooking skills to good use by bringing in food for her co-workers, John says. âAs Chinâs manager, I hear about the positive impact that she makes every time I walk through this unit,â John says. âShe is integrated into the ICU department and adds to the culture of excellence in this unit. Chin is not just a housekeeper; she is truly a part of the care team on this unit and well-respected by the ICU staff, patients, and family visitors.â Chin brings a cheerfulness to her job, interacting with patients and their families. âEven though they donât talk, they still can hear you,â she says. âI go in (and) I always say, âGood morning, Iâm here to clean your room again!â I just like talking, and sometimes (Iâll hum). âSometimes, when the patients wake up, theyâll say, âOh, that was you! I hear you every morning.â It makes you feel good.â John says Chin is dedicated, friendly, and hard-working. He says she often will stay past the end of her shift or come in on off days to help. Thatâs just part of who Chin is. âEverything is good. I enjoy being here and the people,â Chin says. âI canât wait to come to work because I like my job. Everything I do, I feel like Iâm doing good.â Erik Trentrock âI feel very lucky to work with an amazing team, not only on the rehab unit but throughout the hospital,â Erik says. âThe people here really care about the patients and the families that we care for. Itâs really just a pleasure working in that kind of environment because weâre always striving to provide the best possible care and improve the care that we provide. Being in a group of people like that is a really, really special experience.â remove add Meet Erik Trentrock! Before coming to Pittsburgh, Erik Trentrock, PT, DPT, NCS, worked in Washington, D.C., primarily helping adult patients rehabilitating from stroke and brain injuries. However, he also worked part-time on a unit that was a partnership with the nearby childrenâs hospital, helping pediatric patients. âI really just fell in love with that population and was looking for more of a full-time role working in pediatric inpatient rehab,â Erik says. He found that at UPMC Childrenâs Hospital of Pittsburgh. For his dedication to helping children of all ages recover from injury and illness, Erik is this monthâs UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero. Erik came to UPMC Childrenâs in 2014 and currently serves as the therapy coordinator on the inpatient rehabilitation unit. He oversees a team of four physical and occupational therapists and also provides direct patient care. âErik embodies the epitome of a health care hero,â says Kristen Straka, DNP, RN, CPN, NEA-BC, senior director, Emergency Department, Behavioral Science Division, and Rehabilitation Services, UPMC Childrenâs. âAs a coordinator, Erik oversees the daily therapy operations on the inpatient rehab unit. He consistently looks for ways to improve the therapy services delivered on the inpatient rehab unit and to foster the continued growth and development of the staff he supervises.â At UPMC Childrenâs, Erik works with patients as young as 6 months old and as old as 27 years old. He enjoys the challenge of helping patients of varying ages as they recover from many different injuries and illnesses. âIn the adult world, a lot of times, therapists will work on a single unit,â Erik says. âSo, maybe theyâre on the spinal cord injury unit, and they work with adults with spinal cord injury. Or they work on the brain injury unit, and they work with adults with brain injury. âWith pediatrics, we do see a lot of children who have brain injuries and children and adolescents with spinal cord injuries, but we also see kids after a complex transplant, or we see kids with cerebral palsy or kids who have had a respiratory illness or Down syndrome and hospital-acquired deconditioning. So, thereâs an interesting challenge that I enjoy that comes with trying to treat a wide range of diagnoses and a wide range of ages.â Erik tries to make the rehabilitation experience fun for kids. For a patient who needed a brace on their knee to keep their leg straight, he devised a rehab session where they walked like a pirate with a peg leg. For another patient who was on a ventilator, Erik created a scenario where they worked to pull up plastic flower âweedsâ in the gymnasium. âThere's a creative aspect (of pediatric rehab) where, by optimizing the motivation of the child, you can optimize their functional outcomes and quality of life,â Erik says. In addition to his patient care and manager roles, Erik oversees the certification process for UPMC Childrenâs inpatient rehab unit through the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). Erik helps UPMC Childrenâs to retain its accreditation. âErik is hard-working, innovative, creative, and dedicated,â Kristen says. âHe has shown this through his leadership not only on CARF but through his interactions with patients and families.â More than 10 years into working at UPMC Childrenâs, Erik enjoys coming to work and helping kids. He says he also loves being a part of UPMC Childrenâs, which is ranked among the best childrenâs hospitals in the country by U.S. News and World Report. âI feel very lucky to work with an amazing team, not only on the rehab unit but throughout the hospital,â Erik says. âThe people here really care about the patients and the families that we care for. Itâs really just a pleasure working in that kind of environment because weâre always striving to provide the best possible care and improve the care that we provide. Being in a group of people like that is a really, really special experience.â Dr. Jake Larkin âThe complexity of running an obstetric program here is really high. It requires thoughtful colleagues and dedicationâ he says. âIt's just pretty inspiring to come into work and see that day-to-day. âI think the crew of people we have at Magee Hospital at every level is just really a special group,â he adds. âI'm honored to be a part of it. I want to recognize my colleagues from nursing in particular, who are really the people that keep things running and make it work.â remove add Meet Dr. Jake Larkin! When Jake Larkin, MD, first came to Pittsburgh for medical school, he had no plans of becoming an ob-gyn. Then he had an opportunity to shadow a doctor at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital and see a baby being born. âI had never seen a baby being born before, and it just blew me away,â says Dr. Larkin, maternal fetal medicine (MFM) specialist, UPMC Magee. âTo see this human being emerge and start a life was just really, really awe-inspiring.â Almost 25 years later, Dr. Larkin still feels that sense of awe when he sees a baby being born. For his compassionate and expert care in maternal fetal medicine, Dr. Larkin is this monthâs UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero Spotlight. After attending the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and completing his residency in Philadelphia, Dr. Larkin came to UPMC Magee as a fellow in 2008. Heâs been with the hospital ever since, helping to treat mothers and their unborn children. Dr. Larkin says he enjoys the complexity of treating two separate yet interconnected patients. As a maternal fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Larkin treats high-risk pregnancies, which adds another layer of complexity. Thereâs an element of internal medicine, which means diagnosing complex health problems. And then thereâs an element of surgery, being able to think quickly and make decisions in critical situations. âSometimes, deliveries can be high stakes, and if you make a mistake, there can be lifelong implications,â Dr. Larkin says. We're not always talking about chronic disease problems that will tend to progress around a pretty predictable timeline. Sometimes, you really have to get it right quickly. âSometimes, if there's a fetus in distress, you need to act promptly. You need to know it, recognize it, and act quickly. And sometimes, you need to do that while kind of accounting for maternal conditions that are at play.â The job also requires sensitivity and compassion in helping patients who are dealing with the challenges of a high-risk pregnancy. âThatâs where the art of medicine comes in,â Dr. Larkin says. âThat's not an intellectual exercise. I think it's about being kind. It's a really important and hard-to-define skill. âWhen someone is vulnerable and perhaps at one of the most important moments of their lives, to be able to achieve a partnership with them and walk them through complex medical decisions with sensitivity, thatâs what you hope for.â UPMC Magee has been a national leader in providing womenâs health care for over a century. Every year, 10,000 babies are born in the hospital. Dr. Larkin says he considers it a privilege to work there. âThe complexity of running an obstetric program here is really high. It requires thoughtful colleagues and dedicationâ he says. âIt's just pretty inspiring to come into work and see that day-to-day. âI think the crew of people we have at Magee Hospital at every level is just really a special group,â he adds. âI'm honored to be a part of it. I want to recognize my colleagues from nursing in particular, who are really the people that keep things running and make it work.â Jim Klavon As a senior resource pool nurse, he goes wherever heâs needed. And that could be anywhere in the hospital. âThey just tell me where Iâm needed for the night, and depending on what floor, I go wherever they tell me to,â Jim says. âIâve worked in the intensive care unit. Iâve worked on our step-down unit. Ortho, med-surg, emergency department. So, pretty much anywhere they need. remove add Meet Jim Klavon! Jim Klavon, RN, typically doesnât know where heâll be going when he arrives at UPMC St. Margaret for his shift each night. As a senior resource pool nurse, he goes wherever heâs needed. And that could be anywhere in the hospital. âThey just tell me where Iâm needed for the night, and depending on what floor, I go wherever they tell me to,â Jim says. âIâve worked in the intensive care unit. Iâve worked on our step-down unit. Ortho, med-surg, emergency department. So, pretty much anywhere they need. âI think the only place Iâve never actually worked was inside an operating room. But Iâve also worked in the PACU (post-anesthesia care unit) recovery room. Pretty much anywhere they need me, thatâs the way it goes on a nightly basis.â For his willingness and ability to fill many roles, Jim is this monthâs UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero. Jim has worked in nursing for 42 years, including over 20 years at UPMC St. Margaret. He worked in various units full-time â psychiatry, emergency department, intensive care, and more â before moving to the resource pool full-time. As a resource pool nurse, Jim needs an extensive skill set because each unit has a different purpose and different types of patients. But he leans on his experience and the people he works with. âJim is dependable and a consistent part of the care team, even though he floats throughout the hospital,â says Dawn Rankin, MSN, RN, NE-BC, director, capacity management, resource pool, and support services, UPMC St. Margaret. âJim is admired as a senior nurse and often sought out for his knowledge and experience â or just for a new IV. He impacts the growth of our new nurses and provides a sense of support to the units.â Before becoming a nurse, Jim was a Navy Hospital Corpsman, helping provide care to Navy members. To this day, he has a connection with patients who are veterans. âSometimes, we put little signs on the door, or you go in, and they have a hat on,â he says. âYou thank them. You can sort of relate to them. You know some of the stuff theyâve been through. It touches me. Itâs special.â One of the lessons Jim learned in the Navy was the value of teamwork â the importance of the person next to you. Thatâs something he continues to value today with the people he works with at UPMC St. Margaret. âAn important part of it all is the people that I work with,â he says. âTheyâre really great people, and I get to know everybody in the whole hospital. The biggest change is when we have new people come in, and old people leave that youâve been working with for years. But Iâm mellow, tolerant, and get along with people generally.â Dawn says Jim is an important part of the team, caring for his patients, co-workers, and families. She says he often hears from patients that Jim will take the time to listen to their medical concerns. When a co-worker was recently in the hospital, Jim went to the cafeteria each morning to get her husband a cup of coffee, âknowing that the husband did not want to leave his wifeâs bedside unless it was necessary,â says Emily Wickline, PhD, MSN, RN, CMSRN, senior clinician, resource pool, UPMC St Margaret. âJim is supportive and collaborative within the team,â Dawn says. âHe advocates for changes to leadership and stands alongside his co-workers when they need help. After being a nurse for 40 years, you tend to have strong critical thinking skills, and Jim is always willing to share his knowledge with others.â Jim acknowledges he gets âa little crankyâ sometimes while âtrudging (his) bones into the hospital.â But he says heâs holding up well physically and mentally and plans to work as long as he can. âI like what Iâm doing,â he says. âLuckily, Iâm a nurse, and youâre not honed into one thing. Iâve done different areas of nursing. I like working with people, taking care of the patients, and definitely, the person next to me â the camaraderie. â â¦ Itâs satisfying. At the end of the day, I feel good about what I did. I helped someone.â Larry Simmons Larry is dedicated to his work, picking up extra shifts if needed or filling various roles. He says his parents instilled that mentality in him. âMy mother and father stayed on us,â he says. âThey said if youâre looking for an easy day, then thereâs no such thing in life. Youâve got to go and give it your all: give 110%.â remove add Meet Larry Simmons! Larry Simmons says his mentality as a kitchen steward is the same as his mentality from his days in the military. âWherever they need me, Iâm there,â says Larry, whoâs worked at UPMC Mercy for five years. âJust plug me in anywhere.â For his dedication to his work and willingness to fulfill many roles, Larry is this monthâs UPMC Pittsburgh Penguins Healthcare Hero. As a kitchen steward, Larryâs responsibilities include washing pots and pans, cleaning the kitchen and dish areas, taking out trash, delivering trays, and much more. âBy diligently washing pots and pans, taking out the garbage, cleaning the kitchen, and ensuring items are properly sanitized through the dish machine, Larry helps prevent the spread of illness and supports the well-being of the patients and staff,â says Jennifer McKelvey, director of Food and Nutrition Services at UPMC Mercy. âHis commitment to these tasks ensures that meals are prepared in a clean space and that the dietary department functions smoothly.

Youâve got to go and give it your all: give 110%.â Larry was an Army Special Forces sniper for 12 1/2 years. He says his service taught him the value of teamwork in accomplishing a mission. âYou depend on each other, and everyone is somebody that you have to depend on to make sure you get through the next day,â Larry says. He continues to see the value of teamwork today in the UPMC Mercy kitchen. He says from leadership on down, the staff works together to fulfill their daily mission of providing quality food in a clean, safe environment. âYou need teamwork to make sure that everything and everybody are doing their job, so we can all make sure our patients, our guests, and our fellow employees have a good meal, are safe, and are comfortable,â Larry says. Jennifer says Larry helps to create a positive environment both through his attitude and his actions. For example, he buys lunch for his co-workers and recently hosted a surprise baby shower for one of them. He also recently worked with a co-worker who has special needs and wanted to learn how to wash dishes. Jennifer says Larry took the time to work with that employee and teach him the finer details of washing dishes in a supportive way. âLarry is known for his hard-working, dedicated nature and friendly interactions with everyone he encounters, whether customers, co-workers, or patient family members,â Jennifer says. âHe goes above and beyond to create a supportive and welcoming environment, often showing kindness through thoughtful gestures. âLarryâs actions come from the heart, with no expectation of recognition or rewards, making him an invaluable and beloved presence in the workplace.â Although he doesnât expect rewards, Larry has received them. Before coming to UPMC, he worked at another hospital for 33 years, filling many different kitchen and dining roles. He was twice named Employee of the Year. Larry retired from that job, but after six months, he says he felt bored and wanted to return to work. That brought him to UPMC Mercy, where heâs become a valuable member of the team. âOn a daily basis, I give 100%, and I feel my department gives me 100% to make sure that we get everything done and make sure everyone is pleased with the service they receive here,â he says.

She says she always felt drawn to the emergency department. âYou are there by the patientâs side during the good times, the bad times, the victories, the failures, all of that,â she says. âIt's a beautiful thing to be a part of that. And I've always wanted to be that positive person because, especially in emergency medicine, I'm meeting patients on the worst day of their lives or what they believe is the worst day of their lives.â Soon after Kayla became a nurse, she took training to become a forensic nurse and sexual assault nurse examiner. Those nurses care for victims of sexual violence, intimate partner violence, child abuse, elder abuse, and more. âForensic nursing is always something I've been interested in because you can make such an impact,â she says. âIt's not an immediate impact. It's not an instant satisfaction with these cases because they take a long time to go through the court systems and whatnot. But to be that one person that can sit there and just listen to these patients and process their accounts of what happened and be their advocate â¦ is just an amazing opportunity.â Betsy Tedesco, DNP, clinical director, Emergency Services, UPMC Passavant, says Kayla âgoes above and beyond with compassion, drive, and empathy.â Those qualities help her to succeed at work. âDespite the patients in the ED experiencing a stressful situation, Kayla always makes them comfortable, safe, and protected,â Betsy says. âShe communicates openly and makes sure that the patients and their loved ones have their questions or concerns answered.â Kayla also is among the first people to volunteer to take on a responsibility, Betsy says. She was the first employee to volunteer to work in UPMC Passavantâs COVID-19 monoclonal antibody clinic, which provided treatments to COVID-19 patients. She also leads her departmentâs employee experience council, which strives to build teamwork, communication, collaboration, and positive relationships. âWhen you have the ability to openly communicate with each other, the patients have a better outcome,â Kayla says. âThey have a better experience because everybody's collaborating together on what we could do for this patient.â Betsy says the council was a major undertaking, but Kayla made it a priority. Itâs an example of her dedicated approach to her job. âKayla is always hard-working, dedicated, compassionate, committed, and a true servant leader,â Betsy says. âShe is always two feet first into any situation, always there to help, and always provides support to those around her.â Kayla acknowledges that working in the emergency department can be emotionally taxing. But she comes to work to help patients in their most stressful situations and give them the answers they need. âThey're so incredibly vulnerable that whole time,â she says. âJust a smile or just sitting down next to them, even if it's for 30 seconds, can make such a significant difference, and itâs worth it.â âTo be able to give them an answer and help them get through this time (is so important).â Founding Partners X Instagram Facebook YouTube TikTok LinkedIn Privacy Policy Contact Us pittsburghpenguins.com is the official website of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

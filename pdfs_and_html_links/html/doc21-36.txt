Gamebook Mike Tomlin went to Dublin looking for "complementary football" from his Steelers, and they delivered in a 24-21 win over the Minnesota Vikings. It was a complete team victory as Aaron Rodgers completed his first 10 passes, DK Metcalf made 5 catches for 126 yards, the offensive line led reserve running back Kenneth Gainwell to 99 yards rushing (plus 35 yards receiving), and the defense recorded 6 sacks and 3 takeaways while holding the Vikings to 70 yards rushing. "We talked a lot about the late, great Ambassador Dan Rooney last night," said Tomlin. "I know he's smiling at us today. It's just an honor to fulfill his vision, to bring NFL football to Dublin. Been thinking about him a lot on a personal level." It wasn't just the usual stars who came out for the Steelers in Dublin. Players such as Payton Wilson, Kaleb Johnson, DeShon Elliott, Broderick Jones, Patrick Queen, Derrick Harmon, James Pierre, etc. each had shining moments in bringing the Steelers home with a 3-1 record at the bye. Of course, it wasn't easy. The Steelers survived a furious Vikings rally that saw them come back from a 24-6 deficit to driving for a potential game-tying field goal in the final minute. But Nick Herbig forced an intentional grounding penalty that cost the Vikings 16 yards and a 10-second run-off. The play brought up second-and-26 at the Minnesota 23-yard line with 28 seconds remaining, which led to a fourth-and-17 pass breakup by Elliott to end any threat.

(Karl Roser/ Pittsburgh Steelers) Karl Roser/Pittsburgh Steelers Advertising This Ad will close in 3 The Vikings opened the scoring after it appeared the Steelers had, only to have the touchdown reversed on replay. A forced fumble by safety Chuck Clark of Vikings running back Jordan Mason was returned 61 yards by Jalen Ramsey for an apparent first-quarter Steelers touchdown. But the play was reversed when Mason was shown to have "control" of the ball with his foot out of bounds. The Vikings retained possession, and Will Reichard kicked a 41-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead with 6:24 left in the first quarter. Queen came free on a blitz to sack Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz on third down to force the field goal. The Steelers answered with a 1-yard touchdown run by Gainwell â starting in place of game-day scratch Jaylen Warren â to cap off a beautifully orchestrated 71-yard drive. Rodgers got Gainwell, Calvin Austin, Metcalf, Johnson, and Jonnu Smith involved, with throws to Metcalf of 14, 17, and 11 yards being the high points. The latter pass to Metcalf moved the Steelers to the Minnesota 7-yard line, from where Gainwell caught a 6-yard pass and then ran left for a 1-yard touchdown and 7-3 Steelers lead with 55 seconds left in the first quarter. A third-down sack by Herbig forced the Vikings to punt and, on their first snap of the second quarter, Metcalf took a slant from Rodgers and raced 80 yards for a quick-strike touchdown that put the Steelers ahead, 14-3, with 12:28 left in the first half. Metcalf received a key downfield block from Austin to get into the end zone. The Steelers missed an opportunity to add a field goal late in the half when Chris Boswell's 30-yard attempt was blocked by Isaiah Rodgers with 1:38 on the clock. Instead, it was the Vikings ending the half with a field goal. A roughing-the-passer penalty on Harmon, on top of a 10-yard gain, got the Vikings off their own 9-yard line. The end result was a 28-yard field goal by Reichard with 12 seconds left to cut the Steelers lead to 14-6 at halftime. The Steelers bumped their lead to 21-6 in the third quarter on a 4-yard touchdown run by Gainwell. The drive was set up by Cam Heyward's deflection and Watt's interception and return to the Minnesota 35. From there, Rodgers threw an 8-yard pass to Darnell Washington, and Gainwell and the line did the rest. Gainwell carried 4 times for the final 27 yards, with the scoring run coming behind Pat Freiermuth, Spencer Anderson, and the left side of the line with 2:23 left in the third. Another third-down sack of Wentz â this one by Keeanu Benton â set up the Steelers for a field goal drive to open the fourth quarter. Rookie running back Johnson had 4 carries for 19 yards to set up Boswell's 33-yard field goal and the Steelers led by 24-6 with 11:18 to play. The Vikings' rally began on the next drive. On third-and-4, Wentz threw 16 yards to Zavier Scott for a touchdown, and Wentz's pass to Jalen Nailor for the 2-point conversion cut the Steelers' lead to 24-14 with 7:50 left. The Vikings turned the runaway into a nailbiter by stopping the Steelers on fourth-and-goal from the 3-yard line, when Gainwell could gain only 2 yards. From their 1, the Vikings flipped the field with an 11-yard pass to Justin Jefferson and an 81-yard pass to Jordan Addison. Wilson, hustling down the field (NextGen Stats clocked him at 22.48 mph, the fastest clocking by an NFL linebacker since at least 2017), dove to tackle Addison at the Pittsburgh 1. The Vikings eventually scored on fourth down, but the diving tackle by Wilson took approximately 1 minutes off the game clock. The 2-yard TD pass to Nailor cut the Steelers' lead to 24-21 with 2:08 remaining. Roman Wilson recovered the onside kick, but the Steelers ended up punting into the end zone, giving the Vikings a final chance with the ball at their 20 and 1:01 remaining. But the QB pressure by Herbig forced the grounding penalty to stall the Vikings' drive as the Steelers improved to 3-1. Tomlin reported after the game that Austin was taken to a local hospital with a shoulder injury. Defensive backs Ramsey, Brandin Echols, and Darius Slay were in and out of the game with injuries, alternately joining injured starter Joey Porter Jr. on the sideline. "Our depth has been tested," said Tomlin. "It will be good to get a week off and get healthier and get ready for what lies ahead."

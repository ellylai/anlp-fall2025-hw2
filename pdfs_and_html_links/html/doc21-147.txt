Gwen's Girls was launched in 2002 to help empower girls and young women to have productive lives through holistic, gender-specific programs, education and experiences through afterschool, school and community-based programming throughout Greater Pittsburgh. Dr. Kathi Elliott, the Steelers 2023 Inspire Change recipient, has steered Gwen's Girls towards becoming a well-recognized forerunner in the integration of evidence-based clinical prevention and intervention policies and practices that enhance the child and social welfare system. In addition, she spearheaded the formation of the Black Girls Equity Alliance (BGEA), a collaboration of over 75 practitioners, researchers, system administrators, and other stakeholders committed to addressing systemic inequities in the juvenile justice, child welfare, education, and health care systems. Smith spent time on Tuesday visiting with the girls in the BGEA program, learning more about their advocacy work regarding the juvenile justice system. Smith is going to honor the organization by wearing shoes to support them during the team's My Cause My Cleats game in November. He presented the group with the shoes Smith also gifted them with new sneakers to paint to highlight their work at Gwen's Girls and surprised the group with tickets to the My Cause My Cleats game in November, where they will showcase the sneakers they painted. Hometown Huddle: Steelers players Connor Heyward and Logan Lee spent Tuesday afternoon at the Boys & Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania as a part of the team's United Way Hometown Huddle. The Steelers have been taking part in the Hometown Huddle, done in conjunction with the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania, for over 20 years. The program brings the players and local youth together for fun activities that stress the importance of health and fitness, as well as the key to having fun activities in everyday life. Plenty of smiles: Steelers rookies were having a good time on Tuesday morning, visiting patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The rookies spent time playing games with the kids, doing craft projects and posing for pictures in the hospital's Fred Rogers Atrium. The visit is one of the endeavors for the team's rookie class, who are committed to giving back to the community throughout the season. Friday, September 12 A special day: The Steelers made a wish come true for a special fan on Friday. Jared Valdez, who is from Nevada, was a guest of the team at practice through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Valdez, who has heart issues, was on hand with his family, taking in practice and meeting players and coaches, including getting pictures and autographs from all of his favorites. Valdez will also be at Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks at Acrisure Stadium. "It was always a dream to come out and experience all this, what's happening right now, see the players," said Valdez. "It's crazy because seeing them now in person, it doesn't even look like they're human. Their giants. "I'm very excited right now. I'm nervous. I appreciate Make-A-Wish and the Steelers, getting to go to the game too. It's crazy. And it's opening day too." Alysa Rubin/Pittsburgh Steelers Alysa Rubin/Pittsburgh Steelers Thursday, September 11 Making a wish come true: She might have been quiet and shy, but the smile on Illiana Lyon's face spoke volumes. The 18-year-old was enjoying every moment of Steelers practice, there on Thursday as a guest of the team through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Lyon, who is going through treatment for leukemia, had the opportunity to meet players and coaches following practice, including some of her favorites like Pat Freiermuth, Alex Highsmith and Mason Rudolph, who sent her videos while she was going through treatments earlier this year. "She has been in the hospital nine and half out of the last 12 months," said James 'Buddy' Lawver, her step-father. "She was really struggling and went through a lot of stuff. It really beat up her body through this treatment for this leukemia. Make-A-Wish came to the hospital, and they brought videos and Alex, Mason and Pat, who were giving their best wishes and brought a little swag box. She just lit up and it gave her some motivation that there's life outside of the hospital" The family will also go to the Steelers game against the Seattle Seahawks at Acrisure Stadium on Sunday as a guest of the team.

The team worked with local branches of the military, including the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. "I think it's proof that the support for the veteran community is real," said Captain Eric Humer of the United States Marine Corps. "It's not just talk, and I think it's a great way to put pause and say we share a lot in common as a nation and as a city. Specifically representing the Marine Corps, there's not a lot of Marines out here, so it's really great for us to be able to spend time together and share a story and our experiences with the players and the staff, and the players and staff share their experiences with us. "I think it's pretty special to be able to see the players in their environment and then be able to take time and talk with them. Obviously it's a busy week coming up, it's the first week of the season, and for them to set some time aside to talk with the service members and just share a laugh, share a story, shake some hands, I think is pretty awesome and unique and special." Three football stations, including passing, receiving and field goal kicking, were set up around the field, a perfect opportunity for the military members to test their skill level with those who do it for a living. Among the players taking part were Cole Holcomb, Isaiahh Loudermilk, Mason Rudolph and Corliss Waitman, along with the team's rookie class. In addition to the drills, the players posed for pictures with the military members as they shared stories of watching football while on deployment. "I've got a lot of respect for people who've sacrificed for our freedom," said Rudolph. "My great grandfather fought in World War II. I think people in my generation sometimes take it for granted. I've been blessed and thankful I haven't had to fight in a war. "I think sometimes we take our freedom for granted, and so anytime I can come out and have a conversation or support any sort of program like this where you can meet some of these people that have sacrificed so much, it's a great opportunity and I try to make time for it. "I've got an immense amount of respect for the bravery, the courage, and then the toll it takes on the family when you're away from your family that long. I am happy to be here and do something like this event."

Freiermuth worked in conjunction with the Education Partnership, who provide supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania, to provide necessities for the Clairton students at an Adopt-A-School assembly. Freiermuth distributed backpacks and school supplies to the students, bringing not just much needed items, but also plenty of laughter and joy. "It's very special just seeing all the kids smile," said Freiermuth. "It's an exciting part of their day, and it's also an exciting part of my day. It's always fun to see their reaction, see the smiles when they get a new backpack and the school supplies. It means a lot because they are excited to see me there as well. "I enjoy the opportunity to be able to give back." Freiermuth also made a $10,000 donation to the Salvation Army of Western Pennsylvania, which is holding a fundraiser to support relief efforts in the aftermath of U. S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works explosion, which tragically took the lives of two people and injured more than 10 others earlier this month. "I want to be able to help people as much as I can," said Freiermuth. "It's important to do our part." About the fundraiser: Those who wish to join in support can visit salvationarmywpa.org/steel or text the word "steel" to 31333 to make a monetary donation, 100 percent of which will be used to support the immediate families of the deceased as well as those who suffered significant injuries and were or remain hospitalized. Donations for this fundraiser will be collected up until September 30, 2025. Golf for a cause: Pat Freiermuth and Mason McCormick took part in the annual Tee Up Fore Bundle-Up Mini Golf Classic at Puttshack Pittsburgh. The fun event included a competitive nine-hold round of miniature golf, dinner and prizes with all of it benefitting Project Bundle-Up. Freiermuth is the ambassador for Project Bundle-Up, taking part in multiple activities to help champion the cause. The Salvation Army's Project Bundle-Up is a program started by two late Pittsburgh staples, Patricia Rooney, the wife of late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, and Joe DeNardo, the former WTAE-TV weatherman. The program is focused on providing winter outwear for kids and others in need in the Pittsburgh area and focusing on taking them shopping to pick out their own items. Thursday, August 28 Congrats to Connor Hiser, our 1st 2025 Jerome Bettis Leadership Award Winner! ð A true leader for @SFLionsFB & his communityâConnor gives back through NHS, the Miracle League, Veterans Rock Concert & mentoring youth on & off the field. pic.twitter.com/qgQ6ubRvnP — Steelers Youth Football (@SteelersYouthFB) August 28, 2025 Monday, August 18 Back to school in style: The new school year is about to get underway for many kids in the area, and the importance of sending kids back to the classroom with all the necessities is definitely a priority. That is why the Steelers joined forces with others to be a part of the 13th Annual Pittsburgh Public Schools Back to School Event at Acrisure Stadium. This year, Cameron Heyward's foundation, The Heyward House, worked hand-in-hand with the team to provide support for kids and families. Students received backpacks stuffed with the school necessities, while books and food were also available, while The Heyward House provided hygiene kits. Students were able to enter Acrisure Stadium to take advantage of all of the activities, or participate in the drive-thru version where they were able to still get free school supplies and other essentials without having to leave their car. The event was also something the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation were a part of. Sunday, August 17 Giving back: Safety DeShon Elliott hosted a back-to-school event for the second year in a row. This year, Elliott provided back to school supplies for 250 kids through the Young Black Motivated Kings and Queens (YBMKQ). The kids all received backpacks and supplies for the year, with food, music and fun activities also a part of the afternoon event. "It was really cool, especially being able to see some of the same kids that I worked with last year," said Elliott. "Some of them have grown. There were a couple of boys who grew about six or eight inches over the summer, so it's really cool. "We gave out groceries, school supplies, backpacks, food and clothes for the year. We had bounce houses. It was just a good day just to hang out with the kids." Elliott has a generous heart, not just handing out one of everything to the kids, but allowing them to take as much as they need of the supplies and so forth, and also supplying them with clothing attire to take a lot of pressure off parents. "They brought their parents too," said Elliott. "Seeing how appreciative that the parents are for my help, I think it's pretty cool. I genuinely don't care about me when it comes to that. It's about seeing how happy I make their families, how easy I make it on the parents as well, knowing they don't have to go out and buy an extra pair of shoes or school supplies for the year. I let them take as much as they need to get them through the year." Friday, August 15 A desire to give back: Cornerback Joey Porter Jr. held his Back to School Event at the Jasmine Nyree Campus. Porter distributed backpacks, school supplies and provided food and drinks to the kids to prepare them for the upcoming school year. "This is something my mom and I sit down and talk about every year, just wanting to give back to the community as much as possible," said Porter. "It's a great feeling to have a new backpack, new supplies going into the school year. It makes you feel good about starting the year off right. I'm just trying give kids that special feeling going into the school year on their first day." The Porter family, including Joey Porter Sr. who will be going into the Steelers Hall of Honor this year, have made a commitment to give back through the Jasmine Nyree Homes and this is just a part of that commitment. "It's priceless when you can see the reaction from the kids," said Porter. "That what you do it for. That is why we're going to keep on doing it. Just to know you put a smile on the kids' faces is special, and even the parents when they're satisfied that their kids have the right supplies to go to school." Thursday, August 14 Back to school bash: Linebacker Alex Highsmith hosted his 4th Annual Back to School Bash for area students at the Best of the Batch Foundation. Highsmith handed out backpacks, books and school supplies to the students through the Alex Highsmith Family Foundation. "It's so important, that's one of the core pillars of our foundation," said Highsmith. "Our foundation is giving back to youth through education. Knowing how important it is for kids to be geared up and ready to go for the new school year is so important. Being out there to help those kids means a lot to me." Highsmith said the highlight is seeing the smiles on the kids' faces as they get their new backpack and spend time together. "That's the best part about it, being there, interacting with the kids and just playing games with them," said Highsmith. "It's really encouraging them for the school year to come, for them to study hard and just be their best selves in the classroom." 2025 Training Camp Events Tuesday, August 12 A wish come true: Brennan Likins had a day to remember at Steelers Training Camp, spending time watching practice on the sidelines and meeting some of his favorite players afterwards. Likins, an 11-year-old from the Pittsburgh area who has a heart issue, was the guest of the Steelers and the Make-A-Wish Foundation at practice at Saint Vincent College. And the joy for him didn't stop there, as the foundation gifted him with Steelers season tickets for the 2025 season. "This means a lot to all of us, especially to Brennan," said his father, Marc Likins. "This is his day. We've watched Steelers games and cheered for the Steelers since he was a baby. So, this is special. "It's really extraordinary for us to be here and get this experience." While Brennan was taking it all in, his eyes wide and his smile bright, his parents were feeling joy as well seeing their young son so happy. "It warms your heart," said Likins. "As a parent, it makes you smile when they're smiling. And I know how excited he's been for this day. It absolutely is heartwarming for all of us. "He has been glued, locked in, the entire time. His younger siblings, at times, are hot or want to drink or whatever. But he wanted to be right on the sideline. He wants to be locked in. He's trying to soak it in. "It's so surreal for him to be granted a wish. It's not something that you ever dream of. But to come to a very, I would say, during a challenging situation in life. To be granted a wish, it brings so much joy and just lightheartedness to a very heavy situation. For us as his parents, and for him, it's special. It's really special." Special guests: The Steelers hosted athletes from Special Olympics Pennsylvania at camp as a part of the team's community relations program.

The mission is to counteract this narrative by embracing the agency and inviting others to do the same, no matter their circumstance or background. The organization engages elementary, middle and high-school-aged youth in becoming the leaders of tomorrow while serving the community.

"With the Youth Leadership Initiative, we're able to work with more kids and have a broader reach," said Blount. "One of the things that we've done is connected with other youth organizations around Western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Washington County, Greene County, Westmoreland County. So, we have a broader reach now. We're able to work and be more effective, reaching more kids. It gives kids, even kids who are not in the system, an opportunity to experience what our program has to offer and help them grow and develop." The idea behind the visit is to help inspire the kids who are taking part and teach the importance of teamwork as the kids go through a series of physical challenges designed for them to work together in teams.

The yearly clinic was open to kids from kindergarten through 8 th grade and featured the players teaching drills and encouraging the kids to be active and positive in their school, home and community life. On Tuesday, our rookies attended the annual Urban Impact Youth Football Clinic. They helped run football drills, create touchdown celebrations and answered questions from the kids about being a professional athlete. pic.twitter.com/egNYCUnuVg — Steelers Community Relations (@SteelersCR) June 17, 2025 Monday, June 16 Rookies giving back: The Steelers kicked off Rookie Community Week with a visit to the Best of the Batch Foundation to see the work Latasha and Charlie Batch do in the community and get involved themselves. On Monday, our rookies took a tour of @BestoftheBatch Foundation and teamed up with their campers for an egg drop competition. Also, they had the opportunity to learn from @CharlieBatch16 about creating impact on the field and in the community. pic.twitter.com/vyfEnYbgzC — Steelers Community Relations (@SteelersCR) June 16, 2025 Monday, June 9 Swinging for a cause: Defensive tackle Cameron Heyward hosted the Irons for Impact Golf Outing on Monday at the Sewickley Heights Golf Club. Heyward was joined by many of his Steelers teammates for a fun day of golf that benefits The Heyward House Foundation. The mission of The Heyward House is to impact the lives of today's youth through childhood hunger prevention, promoting literacy, fighting cancer, supporting students and teachers and more. Looking to help others: Offensive tackle Calvin Anderson, and his wife Sheree Lanihun-Anderson, officially kicked off their foundation at the August Wilson Center. The couple started the Lanihun-Anderson Foundation to serve as a baseline of financial health and peace for others. Their mission is to bridge the financial disparity gap by providing knowledge, resources and opportunities to others. "We started the foundation with a focus on financial literacy," said Anderson. "Both of us have identified that a lot of people, especially in their early adult life, are distracted by trying to manage their finances and understand how to budget. Really simple principles that I think they would benefit greatly from if they learned those as early as possible. "So, we try to target high school and middle school aged kids and just teach them fundamental financial literacy building blocks, like how to budget and what to do when you have a certain amount of money. When they get their first job, for example, they can build a structure that hopefully when they grow into having a professional income, that they have some understanding of what they want to do with their money so they can alleviate that stress and focus on the things that everybody has. Aptitudes that they are gifted with so they can focus on those things as opposed to figuring out how to do with finances." Anderson majored in mathematical economics with a minor in business in college, so he understands first-hand how important learning young about financial management is. "I studied mathematical economics, and in my adult life, I now appreciate how valuable it is to have learned some of the financial principles I learned when I was younger," said Anderson. "So, to be able to give back in the way that we do and to be gifted the platform that I've been able to be gifted through the NFL, it's extremely satisfying just to feel like you're helping one person at a time." Sunday, June 8 Making the game safer: The Steelers hosted their annual USA Football Youth Coach Certification Clinic at Acrisure Stadium, part of a continued effort to make the game safe for young kids across Western Pennsylvania both on and off the field. The program helps area coaches complete their 2025 Youth Tackle Certification in-person, with training and guidance in multiple areas, including direction from former Steelers linebacker Vince Williams. Among the topics that were addressed during the clinic were Health and Safety (Concussions, Heat/Hydration, Sudden Cardiac Arrest), Abuse Prevention, Practical Coaching and Team Management, and Principals of Contact (Shoulder Tackling, Block/Block Defeat, Equipment Fitting, and Levels of Contact). The Steelers help to insure all coaches are able to participate by paying 50 percent of the registration fee for the almost 150 coaches taking part. * * * USA Football's Youth Coach Certification, which is accredited by the United States Center for Coaching Excellence, provides coaches with evidence-based knowledge, resources and skills to ensure they teach age-appropriate skills and work on development of the athletes in a holistic approach. The model used focuses on progressive skill instruction that teaches young athletes age-appropriate skills and meets them at their current stage of development. Thursday, June 5 Not just coffee: Connor Heyward spent time this week visiting Bitty & Beau's Coffee, and it wasn't just to pick up a cup of coffee. Heyward was learning more about the mission of Bitty & Beau's, who are focused on the human rights movement. The coffee shop is a place where people with intellectual and development disabilities are a valued part of the workforce, and where diversity is celebrated. Throughout their nationwide chain, the coffee shop employees more than 400 individuals with disabilities. The owners of the chain, Amy and Ben Wright, have four children, one who was born with autism, and two who were born with Down syndrome, Bitty and Beau. The family learned that over 80 percent of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are unemployed nationwide and wanted to create a place to provide an opportunity for them to succeed, which is how the coffee shop was born. Monday, June 2 Keeping kids active: Monday was a day of fun and games for kids from the Boys & Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania, as they took part in football drills with receiver Ben Skowronek. Skowronek visited the Dick's Sporting Goods House of Sports at Ross Park Mall, running drills with the kids in a effort to encourage being active and playing outside as the summer months have arrived.

After being closed for the 2024 season, there was an official ribbon cutting for the return of the Steelers themed roller coaster, with it back in action for the amusement park's 2025 season. "We missed it," said Ryan Huzjak, the Steelers vice president of sales and marketing. "It was an exciting process to get it up and running and see it go through it's first season. We have been patiently waiting for all of the improvements to be made so it can be up and running consistently. We are excited for the re-opening and hopefully a long run." The Steel Curtain is part of Kennywood's Steelers Country, which was introduced in 2019. For former Steelers defensive back Mike Logan, Kennywood will forever be a part of his life as he grew up in the shadows of the park. "Kennywood is part of the journey and legacy I will leave behind. It will always be a staple of my life," said Logan, who was on hand along with former tight end Matt Spaeth, fifth-round draft pick Yahya Black and Steely McBeam. "I was raised in West Mifflin in the projects, and I have many stories to tell about Kennywood. It will always be a part of my journey." For thrill seekers, and those who just love to have their insides turned upside down, The Steel Curtain doesn't disappoint. It takes riders up 220 feet, the tallest coaster in Pennsylvania, and has the highest inversion in North America as well as nine thrilling upside-down twists and turns. And the best part about itâ¦it's black and gold and the football cars are adorned with jersey stripes and Steelers logos. "Growing up I didn't think there was any other amusement park in the world besides Kennywood because that's what I was exposed to," said Logan. "It's like the Steelers. I thought the Steelers were the only team to win a championship because I was born in the 1970s. That was the only franchise I knew winning the Super Bowl. I thought we had the only theme park in the world and the only championship football team in the world. The two go hand-in-hand with my upbringing. My family loved the Pittsburgh Steelers, and they love Kennywood Park." Thursday, May 1 Neighbors helping neighbors: Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and the surrounding area were hit with a destructive storm this past week, with over 400,000 people without power at the peak of it. First responders, city and county staff and area electrical companies have been working around the clock to restore power and clear the area, and the Steelers did their small part to say thank you to them. Tight end Pat Freiermuth, who said he lost power for a short time, delivered lunch to the Duquesne Light campus on Pittsburgh's North Shore, as well as dropping off food for the City of Pittsburgh Public Works. "It's really important," said Freiermuth. "That storm was pretty crazy. It was pretty fast, but it did a lot of damage. "People that are getting the power back on, doing all of the work, they are the ones out there working for long hours, and it means a lot to support them because they support us all of the time. "It's important to do stuff like this. Everybody in the city tunes in to watch us, so anytime we can give back to the community and put a face to a name, see them and hopefully make their day a little better, it means a lot." Saturday, April 26 A 'Big' Draft event: The Steelers teamed up with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Pittsburgh (BBBSPGH) on Saturday for "The BIG Draft" event to help kids who are looking for a mentor. A waiting list of almost 150 youth exists that are searching to be mentored by a Big Brother or Big Sister, but a shortage of volunteers is having an impact. Steelers players attended the event at the West Penn Community Recreation Center, taking part in football drills along and discussing mentors in their lives, along with potential volunteers in an effort to increase the number of Big Brothers and Big Sisters in the Pittsburgh community. Among those participating were Connor Heyward, Logan Lee and Cory Trice Jr. PHOTOS: Big Brothers, Big Sisters Draft event Steelers players participated in football drills with adult and youth participants of the Big Brothers, Big Sisters program at West Penn Recreation Center 1 / 16 Pittsburgh Steelers tight end/fullback Connor Heyward (83) during the Big Brothers, Big Sisters The Big Draft community event on Saturday, April 26, 2025 in Pittsburgh, PA.

(Alysa Rubin / Pittsburgh Steelers) Alysa Rubin/Pittsburgh Steelers Advertising This Ad will close in 3 Wednesday, April 23 Filing a need: When Cameron Heyward sees a need, he takes action. It's how he was raised, and how he has operated since he was a kid. It comes from his mother, Charlotte Heyward, and his late father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward. And the need he once again fulfilled on Wednesday came from the way things were for his father when he was growing up. Heyward, and his foundation The Heyward House, hosted the annual Suiting Up for Success Soiree at Acrisure Stadium, celebrating the accomplishments of local high school seniors. Heyward celebrated male high school seniors in the Pittsburgh area, all chosen by their schools for their leadership, character and ability to overcome challenges faced by today's youth. The Heyward House provided each of them with a custom suit and all the accessories through his 'Craig's Closet' program, as well as a photo shoot and a private dinner with Heyward. The program is one of the many that earned Heyward the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. Craig's Closet has been a staple for The Heyward House since 2018, launched in honor of his father who died from a brain tumor in 2006, at just 39 years old. His father played football at the University of Pittsburgh, and when he arrived as a freshman running back, he had only one suit, something he was grateful to have since he came from a single-parent home with six siblings. With so many young men in Pittsburgh facing the same challenge of not having a suit that they could wear to a job interview, internship, events and more, Heyward produced a plan. Craig's Closet provides free dress clothes to help young men as they move forward in life, and the Suiting Up for Success program is an extension of that. "The idea came from my dad," said Heyward. "When he grew up, he only had one suit. A lot of his friends didn't have suits at all. This is a creative way we thought of to give back to the community and help prepare young men for jobs, or homecoming, moving forward in life. You never know how much a suit can help you present yourself." Thursday, April 17 Showing appreciation: The Steelers held their annual Community Partner Appreciation Breakfast on Thursday at Acrisure Stadium, an opportunity to recognize the amazing work being done by agencies in the Pittsburgh region to make a difference in the communities they serve. The Steelers worked with all of the partners throughout the past year, hosting 77 events in 29 different neighborhoods. As a part of it, over 1,500 meals were distributed, and 600 youth were served during the holiday season. In addition, the Steelers Social Justice Fund provided over $500,000 in donations to local organizations. "We know you are the first line of defense for our vulnerable community members," said Blayre Holmes Davis, the Steelers Senior Director of Community Relations. "We know you are our boots on the ground, and the work that you do is hard. With that, I say thank you for caring for our homeless population, for the woman who just found out she was diagnosed with breast cancer, to creating a welcoming space for our immigrant and refugee population, and to ensuring students have everything they need to have a successful career. "Know that we see you, you will always have a partner in us, and we will do the best we can to support you." Steelers President Art Rooney II and Hall of Fame running back Jerome Bettis were part of a panel discussion about the importance of community involvement and why it is such a staple for the Steelers. "Down through the years we have been fortunate to have players like Jerome on our team, being leaders in our community, making sure they are setting a great example and supporting all of the efforts of people like you," said Rooney. Bettis, who was the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2001 for his community service, learned at a young age how important giving back is. "For me it was pretty easy," said Bettis. "I was impacted by a foundation when I was a young kid in high school, and I was introduced to the game of football. I was more compelled than most to want to give back because of so much that was given to me. My journey with football was because of Reggie McKenzie. He chose to have a football camp for free in Detroit. He had mentoring programs, college SAT programs, so many things I benefited from. "I said to myself, if I can ever be in a position that I can impact others in this kind of way, that is what I am going to do. When I got to Pittsburgh and I saw the community outreach the Steelers were doing, I knew this was the right place I could go out into the community and do much more. "This organization does so much in the community. Much more than many of us ever would have thought or guessed. To see the impact they are making, it makes you proud to be a former Pittsburgh Steeler."

Tight end Pat Freiermuth grew up in a family filled with educators, including his parents Dianne and John Freiermuth, so when he was thinking about a way to give back to the community, the decision was easy. This week he launched the Freiermuth Fund, with education front and center. "My parents and are both educators, my brother is an educator, my sister-in-law is an educator," said Freiermuth. "Basically, everyone in my family are teachers. So, I wanted to give back to schools, specifically the teachers. I wanted to base this off giving to teachers in low-income areas the supplies and stuff needed to have a successful classroom for all the kids. "Sometimes the low-income areas are forgotten and it's harder for kids to have the necessary tools to go on and be successful later in life. So just being able to help provide support for that, it's been big." The mission of the Freiermuth Fund is to 'connect with students and teachers at every level who have big goals but may lack the resources to achieve themâ¦from classroom supplies and technology to financial support.' The Fund's goal is to provide students and educators with the tools necessary to succeed in the classroom and beyond. The plan is to provide classroom essentials and materials, including laptops, books and supplies. "Growing up in the family I did, especially with my parents as educators, they played a major role in the importance of school," said Freiermuth. "Being successful in football in high school and college, they never allowed me to forget how important school is. "If I can do my part to allow teachers to express that to the kids, how important school is, and help them succeed to be successful, then I'm doing something bigger than my impact on the field." The Fund will also honor a Teacher of the Month in the Western Pennsylvania area, with winners selected from online nominations . The Fund will recognize outstanding educators who embody compassion, resilience, and leadership in the classroom. The winning teacher will receive $1,000 toward classroom supplies, a Steelers game day experience and Steelers merchandise. There will also be a season-ending winner who will receive a visit from Freiermuth to their classroom. Freiermuth kicked things off earlier this week when he visited Clairton Elementary School, helping an area that has been through a lot over the past month. Freiermuth worked in conjunction with the Education Partnership, who provide supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania, to provide necessities for the Clairton students at an Adopt-A-School assembly. Freiermuth distributed backpacks and school supplies to the students, bringing not just much needed items, but also plenty of laughter and joy. "It's very special just seeing all the kids smile," said Freiermuth. "It's an exciting part of their day, and it's also an exciting part of my day. It's always fun to see their reaction, see the smiles when they get a new backpack and the school supplies. It means a lot because they are excited to see me there as well. "I enjoy the opportunity to be able to give back." Freiermuth also made a $10,000 donation to the Salvation Army of Western Pennsylvania, which is holding a fundraiser to support relief efforts in the aftermath of U. S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works explosion, which tragically took the lives of two people and injured more than 10 others earlier this month. "I want to be able to help people as much as I can," said Freiermuth. "It's important to do our part." Freiermuth himself showed the importance of education when he went back to school the last two years to earn his degree from Penn State, completing his mission this summer. "It was great to get it done," said Freiermuth. "I had a lot of help with my academic advisor at Penn State, Todd Kulka. He did a great job getting me on track to graduate and it's just an awesome feeling." Freiermuth left school early for the NFL Draft, but wanted to complete his education for multiple reasons, including making his mother proud. He took 15 online courses during the spring and summer the last two years, earning his Bachelor of Science degree in Labor and Human Resources from Penn State's College of Liberal Arts. Going back to school wasn't easy, but he welcomed the challenge. "It was definitely pretty tough, but I got through it," said Freiermuth. "I was happy to see the smile on my mom's face that I did it." -->> More information on the Freiermuth Fund Related Content news Community Corner: Taking time to listen Follow along for all of the latest Steelers in the Community happenings news Honoring Pittsburgh's finest while helping others Area leaders were honored at the annual Art Rooney Awards Dinner, which benefits the Catholic Youth Association news Scholarship winners grateful for the opportunity Three area students were presented with the Art Rooney Scholarship news Rookies get a full taste of the NFL The Steelers Rookie Development Program helps young players adjust to life in the NFL news A celebration like no other The Mel Blount Youth Home All-Star Celebrity Roast honored the 50th Anniversary of Super Bowl IX news A great day for the Irish The Ireland Funds Pittsburgh dinner was held at Acrisure Stadium on St. Patrick's Day news The Ireland Funds Pittsburgh includes unique online auction The awardees for the 2025 The Ireland Funds Pittsburgh, as well as the online auction, have been announced news Steelers give back through Social Justice Fund Steelers announce more than half a million dollars in donations to this year's Social Justice Fund InitiativeÂ news Holiday cheer is in the air The Steelers are spreading cheer and joy during the holiday season news Community Corner: Holiday magic Follow along for all of the latest Steelers in the Community happenings news Steelers huddle up to bring holiday joy The Steelers hosted their annual Huddle for the Holidays, bringing joy and cheer to those who need a lift Advertising Club Links Club Links TEAM Team Home Roster Depth Chart Coaches Standings Stats Injury Report Transactions Front Office Staff Draft Central NEWS News Home Press Releases Asked and Answered Labriola On Steelers En Español Media Only Site VIDEO Video Home Steelers Live Interviews Sights & Sounds Press Conferences Around the Locker Room Scouting Report Steelers En Español PHOTOS Photos Home Practice Pregame Game Action Karl's Top Pics Community SCHEDULE Schedule Home Current Season Schedule Event Calendar TICKETS Tickets Home Account Manager Buy Tickets NFL Ticket Exchange Gameday Experience Steelers Fan Travel Season Tickets Wait List SBL Marketplace Seat Transfers View From Your Seat Clear Bag Policy FAN ZONE Fan Zone Home Steelers Official Mobile App Contests and Promotions Event Calendar Steelers Podcasts Steelers En Español ACRISURE STADIUM Stadium Home Clear Bag Policy Book an Event Directions Parking Seating Chart Security Guidelines Disability Services Stadium Tours HISTORY History Home Hall of Honor Museum Hall of Honor Hall of Fame Super Bowls COMMUNITY Community Home Community Programs Youth High School Football Showcase Youth Football Camps NFL Clubs NFL Clubs AFC North AFC East AFC South AFC West NFC North NFC East NFC South NFC West More NFL Sites More NFL Sites NFL Football Operations NFL Shop NFL On Location Pro Football Hall of Fame Licensing USA Football NFL Extra Points NFL Ticket Exchange NFL Experience Times Square Download the Official App Download Apps © 2025 Pittsburgh Steelers.

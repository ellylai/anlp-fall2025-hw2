'''
Combination Strategy: Implement at least one established method for combining dense and sparse 
retrieval results. Common approaches include score normalization and weighted averaging, rank-based 
fusion methods (like Reciprocal Rank Fusion), using one method to filter or re-rank results from the 
other, or other ensemble techniques found in the literature. Experiment with different combination 
strategies to see which works best for your dataset.

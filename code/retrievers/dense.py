Dense Retrieval: Use embedding models to create vector representations of documents and queries. 
We recommend starting with sentence-transformers models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for efficiency, 
though you can experiment with other models (For guidance on selecting high-performing embedding 
models, refer to the MTEB Leaderboard) to improve performance. Use FAISS 
(https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for efficient vector storage and similarity search. 
You'll need to implement the pipeline for embedding documents, building the FAISS index, and 
retrieving similar documents for queries.
